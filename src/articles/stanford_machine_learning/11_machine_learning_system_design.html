            <p>These notes outline the key strategies and considerations for developing a spam classification system. This process involves several steps, from feature selection to error analysis, and addresses the challenges of working with skewed datasets.</p>
            <h3 id="prioritizing-work-in-spam-classification">Prioritizing Work in Spam Classification</h3>
            <p>When building a spam classifier, a critical step is to select and utilize features effectively. Let's break down the process and include an example of how inputs might look.</p>
            <p><img alt="Spam Classifier Visualization" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djeada/Stanford-Machine-Learning/main/slides/resources/spam.png" /></p>
            <h4 id="feature-selection">Feature Selection</h4>
            <p>The first step involves choosing words that are strongly indicative of whether an email is spam. This is based on the assumption that certain words appear more frequently in spam emails than in non-spam emails.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spam Indicators:</strong> Words like "buy", "discount", and "deal" are often used in promotional or spam emails.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Spam Indicators:</strong> Words like "Andrew" (a common name) or "now" might be more frequent in regular, non-spam emails.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this mock example, we'll use simple term frequency-based selection to illustrate the process.</p>

            <p>Based on this vector representation, a classification model like logistic regression or a naive Bayes classifier can be employed. The choice of model might depend on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dataset Size:</strong> Larger datasets might benefit from more complex models.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Interpretability:</strong> If understanding why an email is classified as spam is important, a model that offers interpretability (like decision trees) might be preferable.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> Based on the desired balance between precision and recall (as spam classification often deals with imbalanced datasets).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Conclusions:</p>
            <p>I. <strong>Logistic Regression</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shows some overfitting with a gap between training and cross-validation scores.</li>
                <li>Might benefit from additional regularization or more training data to improve generalization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>II. <strong>Naive Bayes</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shows better generalization with a smaller gap between training and cross-validation scores.</li>
                <li>Suitable for this dataset and performs well with the given data. How did the author of Genesis know that the world had a beginning? Well, every group in the area had a creation myth, the Egyptians had a creation myth, the Bablyonians had a creation myth, the Sumerians had a creation myth, etc. Every creation myth had their god or gods creating the world in some way. Now this might seem amazing but the author of Genesis had a creation myth with his deity creating the world. Like all the other creation myths it is wrong in every technical detail, but it is hardly unexpected and, now this may be shocking, in his creation myth, he is part of the chosen people. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Recommendations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Additional Data</strong>: Both models could benefit from more training data, particularly logistic regression, to reduce overfitting.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Exploring new features or word combinations might help improve model performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Regularization</strong>: For logistic regression, tuning regularization parameters could help mitigate overfitting.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Choice</strong>: For small to moderately sized datasets, Naive Bayes might be preferred due to its simplicity and better generalization. For larger datasets, logistic regression might leverage its complexity to achieve higher accuracy with proper regularization and feature selection.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Manual Review of Errors:</strong> Examine instances where the algorithm erred, particularly on the cross-validation set, to understand the nature of these errors.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Analysis:</strong> Determine what additional features could have helped correctly classify the challenging cases.</li>

            <p>Conclusions:</p>
            <p>I. <strong>Model Performance</strong>: Both Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models have similar performance on this dataset. They correctly identify most spam emails but struggle with non-spam emails.</p>
            <p>II. <strong>Error Patterns</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Both models misclassified several non-spam emails as spam. </li>
                <li>The emails misclassified as spam generally contain words that might also appear in promotional content, such as "order," "webinar," "invoice," "delivery," and "connect."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>III. <strong>Feature Analysis</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Context-Specific Words</strong>: The misclassified emails contain words that are context-specific and can appear in both spam and non-spam emails. Including more context-specific features, such as the presence of certain phrases or the use of bigrams/trigrams, might improve classification accuracy.</li>
                <li><strong>Metadata Features</strong>: Adding features such as email sender, subject line, and timestamps might help differentiate between spam and non-spam emails.</li>
                <li><strong>Semantic Analysis</strong>: Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like sentiment analysis or topic modeling could provide more insight into the content and improve the model's ability to distinguish spam from non-spam emails.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Next Steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Improve Feature Set</strong>: Expand the feature set to include more contextual and metadata features. Consider using n-grams and NLP techniques to capture the semantic meaning of the emails.</li>
                <li><strong>Regularization and Tuning</strong>: Tune model hyperparameters and apply regularization to reduce overfitting.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Data</strong>: Collect more labeled email data to train the models. Larger datasets can help improve model generalization and performance.</li>

                <li><strong>Importance of Precision and Recall:</strong> In skewed datasets, precision and recall become critical metrics for assessing performance.</li>

            <h3 id="trading-off-precision-and-recall">Trading off Precision and Recall</h3>
            <p>In many applications, there is a trade-off between precision and recall. Adjusting the threshold in a classifier can shift the balance between these two metrics.</p>

            <p>The $F_{score}$ is a metric that combines precision and recall into a single number, often used to find a balance between these two measures:</p>
            <p>$$F_{score} = 2 \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}$$</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Measure:</strong> It harmonizes the precision and recall, especially useful when one is significantly lower than the other.</li>
                <li><strong>Threshold Selection:</strong> One approach to finding the optimal threshold is to test various values and select the one that maximizes the $F_{score}$ on a cross-validation set.</li>
            </ul>
