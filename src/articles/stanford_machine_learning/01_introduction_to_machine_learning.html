            <header>Introduction to Machine Learning</header>
            <p>Machine Learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence, is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions. It relies on patterns and inference instead. ML algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data," to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. </p>
            <h2 id="types-of-machine-learning">Types of Machine Learning</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supervised learning</strong> involves the use of labeled training data to infer a function that maps input data to the corresponding output. The goal is to learn from example input-output pairs to make accurate predictions on new data.</li>
                <li>In <strong>unsupervised learning</strong>, the algorithm is designed to learn from plain data without any corresponding output variables to guide the learning process. This type of learning aims to identify patterns, relationships, or structures within the data.</li>
                <li><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong> focuses on training algorithms that learn optimal actions through trial and error. This learning method is concerned with how software agents should take actions in an environment to maximize a notion of cumulative reward.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="deep-learning-in-machine-learning">Deep Learning in Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>Deep learning, a subset of ML, uses layered neural networks to simulate human decision-making. Key aspects include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong> are used primarily for processing data with a grid-like topology, such as images.</li>
                <li><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</strong> are suitable for processing sequential data, such as time series or text.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="applications-and-suitability">Applications and Suitability</h3>
            <p>Deep learning is particularly useful in areas such as image and speech recognition, where the volume and complexity of data surpass the capabilities of traditional algorithms.</p>
            <h2 id="prevalence-of-machine-learning">Prevalence of Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>ML's growing importance is attributed to its ability to leverage large amounts of data, enabling machines to recognize patterns and make informed decisions. It's considered a key to building systems that can simulate human intelligence.</p>
            <h2 id="practical-applications-of-machine-learning">Practical Applications of Machine Learning</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Database Mining</strong> is utilized in areas like internet search, understanding user behavior, medical diagnosis, and genomics.</li>
                <li><strong>Autonomous Systems</strong> include self-driving cars, drones, and other systems that make decisions based on data.</li>
                <li><strong>Recognition Tasks</strong> encompass handwriting, speech, and facial recognition.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong> enables machines to understand and respond to human language.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Customizing Programs</strong> are used in personalized recommendation systems like those on Netflix, Amazon, and iTunes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="foundational-concepts-and-definitions">Foundational Concepts and Definitions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Arthur Samuel (1959) defined machine learning as a field of study that enables computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. His pioneering work laid the foundation for the development of algorithms that allow computers to improve their performance on tasks through experience rather than through direct programming.</li>
                <li>Tom Mitchell (1997) proposed a formal definition of machine learning. According to him, a computer program is said to learn from experience E concerning task T and performance measure P if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. This definition emphasizes the importance of measurable improvement in performance as a result of experience, framing machine learning as a process that benefits from data-driven feedback and iterative enhancement.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="supervised-learning">Supervised Learning</h2>
            <p>Supervised learning, a dominant approach in machine learning, focuses on using labeled datasets to train algorithms. These algorithms are then applied to classify data or predict outcomes with a high level of accuracy.</p>
            <h3 id="house-price-prediction-regression-example">House Price Prediction - Regression Example</h3>
            <p>Consider a typical problem: predicting house prices based on their size. For instance, estimating the price of a 750 square feet house. This problem can be approached using different models:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linear Regression</strong> involves using a straight line to fit the data, modeling the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Polynomial Regression</strong> entails fitting a curved line, such as a second-order polynomial, to better capture the complexity of the relationship between variables.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><img alt="house_price_prediction" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37275728/201469371-44d7837e-be00-4328-a978-0a63783e08c1.png" /></p>
            <h3 id="tumor-size-and-prognosis-classification-example">Tumor Size and Prognosis - Classification Example</h3>
            <p>In a classification problem, the aim is to categorize data into discrete groups. For example, determining if a tumor is malignant based on its size is a classic classification problem.</p>
            <p><img alt="malignant_cancer" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37275728/201469417-2f5449d2-62b4-4f36-8eb2-77abc4cb0adf.png" /></p>
            <h3 id="combining-multiple-attributes">Combining Multiple Attributes</h3>
            <p>When considering multiple attributes, such as age and tumor size, classification becomes more intricate. We can use algorithms to draw boundaries between different classes in this multidimensional feature space.</p>
            <p><img alt="age_vs_tumor" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37275728/201469444-d574fbc0-8ed9-4378-a8a4-9c8f44062199.png" /></p>
            <h2 id="unsupervised-learning">Unsupervised Learning</h2>
            <p>Unsupervised learning, in contrast to supervised learning, uses datasets without predefined labels. The goal here is to identify patterns or structures within the data.</p>
            <h3 id="clustering-algorithm-examples">Clustering Algorithm Examples</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google News</strong> clusters similar news stories to provide users with grouped articles on the same topic.</li>
                <li><strong>Genomics</strong> involves classifying types of genetic expressions to understand genetic differences and similarities.</li>
                <li><strong>Microarray Data</strong> is used for grouping individuals based on gene expression patterns to study variations in gene activity.</li>
                <li><strong>Computer Clusters</strong> organize clusters to optimize performance or identify faults, improving computational efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Network Analysis</strong> analyzes customer data in social networks to understand relationships and interactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Astronomical Data</strong> classifies celestial objects based on their properties to facilitate the study of the universe.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="the-cocktail-party-problem">The Cocktail Party Problem</h3>
            <p>The Cocktail Party Problem is an audio processing challenge where the goal is to separate individual audio sources from a mixture of sounds. This scenario is common in environments like parties, where multiple people are talking simultaneously, and you want to isolate the speech of a single person from a recording that captures all the speakers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The objective in the Cocktail Party Problem is to extract distinct audio signals from a complex mixture. This mixture can be influenced by factors such as room acoustics and overlapping speech, making it a challenging task.</li>
                <li>A common approach to solve this problem is Blind Source Separation (BSS). The goal of BSS is to recover original audio signals (the sources) from mixed signals without knowledge about the mixing process.</li>
                <li>Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a crucial technique for tackling this issue. SVD decomposes a matrix, representing audio data, into three matrices that expose the fundamental structure of the data. The mathematical representation of SVD applied to a matrix (X) (representing mixed audio signals) is:</li>
            </ul>
            <p>$$
                X = U \Sigma V^*
                $$</p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>$X$ is the matrix of mixed signals.</li>
                <li>$U$ and $V$ are orthogonal matrices.</li>
                <li>$S$ is a diagonal matrix with singular values.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>SVD is particularly useful here because it provides a robust way to deconstruct the mixed signals into components that are easier to separate and analyze. The orthogonal matrices $U$ and $V$ represent the bases in the original and transformed spaces, respectively, while the singular values in $S$ represent the strength of each component in the data. By filtering or modifying these components, we can work towards isolating individual audio sources from the mix.</p>
            <p>This mock code illustrates the use of SVD for signal reconstruction and ICA for source separation, addressing the Cocktail Party Problem in audio processing:</p>
