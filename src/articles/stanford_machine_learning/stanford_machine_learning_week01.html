            <h2 id="introduction-to-machine-learning">Introduction to machine learning</h2>
            <p>Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions based on data and experience, without being explicitly programmed. It involves training algorithms on a set of labeled data, allowing the algorithm to make predictions or take actions based on new input. There are several types of machine learning, including supervised learning, in which the algorithm is provided with a set of labeled examples to learn from, and unsupervised learning, in which the algorithm is not given any labeled examples and must find patterns and relationships in the data on its own. Machine learning has numerous applications, including in database mining, autonomous systems, handwriting recognition, natural language processing, and self-customizing programs.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Probably the most prevalent form of machine learning type.</li>
                <li>Example: How can we predict housing prices? Ans: Collect house pricing data and examine how it relates to size in feet.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="example-problem">Example problem</h3>
            <p><img alt="house_price_prediction" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37275728/201469371-44d7837e-be00-4328-a978-0a63783e08c1.png" /></p>
            <p>‚ÄùGiven this data, a friend has a house 750 square feet how much can they be expected to get?‚Äù</p>
            <p>What approaches can we use to solve this?
                * Straight line through data. Maybe $150,000.
                * Second order polynomial. Maybe $200,000.
                * One point we‚Äôll go over later is whether to use a straight or curved line.
                * Each of these techniques is a method of carrying out supervised learning.</p>
            <p>We also call this a regression problem
                * Predict continuous valued output (price).
                * No real discrete delineation.</p>
            <p><img alt="malignant_cancer" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37275728/201469417-2f5449d2-62b4-4f36-8eb2-77abc4cb0adf.png" /></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you estimate the prognosis based on the tumor‚Äôs size?</li>
                <li>This is an example of a classification problem.</li>
                <li>Classify data into one of two categories - malignant or not - with no in- betweens.</li>
                <li>In classification problems, the output can only have a discrete number of potential values.
                    You may have many attributes to consider.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We also call this a regression problem

                * No real discrete delineation.

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can try to establish different classes based on that data by drawing a straight line between the two groups.</li>
                <li>Defining the two groups with a more sophisticated function (which we‚Äôll go over later)</li>
                <li>Then, when you have someone with a certain tumor size and age, you can ideally utilize that information to assign them to one of your classes.</li>
