            <h2 id="synchronous-and-asynchronous-replication">Synchronous and Asynchronous Replication</h2>
            <p>Replication is an important concept in database systems, involving the copying of data from one database server, known as the primary, to one or more other servers called replicas. This process enhances data availability, fault tolerance, and load balancing across the system. Understanding the two main replication strategies—synchronous and asynchronous replication—is crucial for designing robust and efficient database architectures.</p>
            <h3 id="replication-strategies">Replication Strategies</h3>
            <p>At its core, replication ensures that data is consistently available across multiple servers. The key difference between synchronous and asynchronous replication lies in how and when data changes are propagated from the primary server to the replicas.</p>
            <h4 id="synchronous-replication">Synchronous Replication</h4>
            <p>In synchronous replication, every write operation on the primary database is immediately propagated to the replicas. The primary server waits for acknowledgments from all replicas before confirming the transaction to the client. This means that data is consistent across all servers at any given moment.</p>
            <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>A client sends a write request to the primary server.</li>
                <li>The primary server writes the data and sends the changes to all replicas.</li>
                <li>Each replica writes the data and sends an acknowledgment back to the primary server.</li>
                <li>Once all acknowledgments are received, the primary server confirms the transaction to the client.</li>
            </ol>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-client">|

            </p>
            <h4 id="asynchronous-replication">Asynchronous Replication</h4>
            <p>Asynchronous replication allows the primary server to confirm transactions without waiting for replicas to acknowledge the data writes. Data changes are sent to replicas after the transaction has been committed on the primary server, which means there may be a delay before replicas are updated.</p>
            <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>A client sends a write request to the primary server.</li>
                <li>The primary server writes the data and immediately confirms the transaction to the client.</li>
                <li>The primary server queues the data changes for replication.</li>
                <li>Replicas receive the data changes asynchronously and update their data.</li>
