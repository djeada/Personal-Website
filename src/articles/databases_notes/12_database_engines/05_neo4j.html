            <header>Neo4j</header>
            <p>Neo4j is a leading open-source graph database management system that specializes in handling data with complex and interconnected relationships. Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables and rows, Neo4j stores data in nodes and relationships, allowing for more natural and efficient modeling of real-world scenarios. Its property graph model enables you to represent entities and their relationships richly, making it ideal for applications that require deep data connections and sophisticated querying capabilities.</p>
            <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
            <p>Neo4j is equipped with a range of features designed to simplify the management and querying of graph data, ensuring high performance, flexibility, and scalability.</p>
            <h3 id="nodes-and-relationships">Nodes and Relationships</h3>
            <p>At the heart of Neo4j are nodes and relationships. <strong>Nodes</strong> represent entities or objects in your data model, such as people, products, or locations. <strong>Relationships</strong> connect these nodes, defining how they interact or are associated with one another, like "FRIENDS_WITH" or "PURCHASED". This structure mirrors real-world connections, making data representation intuitive and straightforward.</p>
            <h3 id="properties">Properties</h3>
            <p>Both nodes and relationships can have properties in the form of key-value pairs. This means you can store detailed information directly within your graph elements. For example, a <code>Person</code> node might have properties like <code>name</code> and <code>age</code>, while a <code>KNOWS</code> relationship could have a <code>since</code> property indicating when two people became friends. This enriches your data model and allows for more precise and meaningful queries.</p>
            <h3 id="indexing-and-constraints">Indexing and Constraints</h3>
            <p>To ensure efficient data retrieval and maintain data integrity, Neo4j supports indexing and constraints. <strong>Indexing</strong> speeds up query performance by allowing quick lookups of nodes and relationships based on their properties. <strong>Constraints</strong> enforce rules on your data, such as uniqueness constraints that prevent duplicate entries for specific properties, ensuring the consistency and reliability of your data.</p>
            <h3 id="cypher-query-language">Cypher Query Language</h3>
            <p>Neo4j utilizes <strong>Cypher</strong>, a powerful and expressive declarative query language specifically designed for graph databases. Cypher's syntax is intuitive and visually resembles the structure of the graph itself, making it easier to write and understand complex queries. With Cypher, you can perform sophisticated graph traversals and data manipulations efficiently, enabling you to extract valuable insights from your data.</p>
            <h3 id="acid-transactions">ACID Transactions</h3>
            <p>Data consistency and reliability are critical in any database system. Neo4j provides full <strong>ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)</strong> transaction support, ensuring that all database operations are processed reliably. This means that even in the event of system failures or concurrent data access, your data remains consistent and the integrity of the database is maintained.</p>
            <h3 id="high-availability">High Availability</h3>
            <p>For applications requiring continuous uptime and resilience, Neo4j offers support for clustering and replication. By deploying Neo4j in a clustered configuration, you can achieve fault tolerance and high availability. This ensures that your database can handle failovers gracefully, maintaining service continuity and data consistency across multiple nodes.</p>
            <h2 id="neo4j-commands">Neo4j Commands</h2>
