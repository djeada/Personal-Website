        <h2>Monorepos</h2>
        <p><i>This article is written in: ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</i></p>
        <p>A monorepo is a single repository that contains all the code for a project, including multiple applications, libraries, and other dependencies. Monorepos are more suitable for large, monolithic projects where there is a need for close collaboration and frequent code reuse.</p>
        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Simplifies cooperation and code reuse: Because everyone is using the same repository, it is much easier to share code and collaborate on changes.</li>
            <li>Simplifies dependency management: Changes to dependencies only need to be made once, rather than in multiple repositories.</li>
            <li>Facilitates refactoring: It is easier to make changes across the entire codebase, rather than in separate repositories.</li>
            <li>May improve build and test times: All code is stored in the same place, so it is faster to build and test changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>May slow down Git operations: As the codebase grows in size, Git may become slower to perform operations such as cloning or pulling.</li>
            <li>May be difficult to manage feature branches: With a large number of branches, it may be harder to keep track of all the changes and ensure that they are properly merged.</li>
            <li>Encourages tight coupling: It is easy to import code from within the same codebase</li>
            <li>May be difficult for new team members to understand: A large codebase can be overwhelming for new team members, making it harder for them to get up to speed and contribute effectively.</li>
            <li>May require a more complex CI/CD setup: Because the entire codebase is built and tested together, the CI/CD system may need to be more sophisticated and capable of handling a large amount of code.</li>
            <li>A force push to the master branch could cause widespread problems: If the master branch becomes broken, it could affect the entire project and team, rather than just a small subset of code.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>When to use</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Suitable for large, monolithic projects with a need for close collaboration and frequent code reuse</li>
            <li>May work well when there is a single team responsible for all the code in the project</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Multirepos</h2>
        <p>A multirepo is a repository for each project, with each repository containing the code and dependencies for that project. Multirepos are more suitable for projects that are divided into multiple, independent components or services.</p>
        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Simplifies versioning: Each service or library has its own versioning, making it easier to track changes and manage dependencies.</li>
            <li>Improves Git performance: Code checkouts and pulls are smaller and separate, so there are no performance issues even as the project grows in size.</li>
            <li>Facilitates independent work: Teams can work independently and do not need access to the entire codebase.</li>
            <li>Improves flexibility: Each team has more freedom and control over their own codebase, allowing for faster development.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Requires coordination of dependencies: The dependencies and libraries used across services and projects must be synchronized on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>Encourages a siloed culture: With separate repositories, there may be a tendency for teams to work in isolation, resulting in duplicate code and a lack of collaboration.</li>
            <li>May be more difficult to share code: Reusing code across repositories requires more effort and coordination.</li>
            <li>May require more complex deployment processes: With multiple repositories, it may be more difficult to coordinate the deployment of changes across all the different components.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>When to use</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Suitable for projects that are divided into multiple, independent components or services</li>
            <li>May work well when there are multiple teams working on different parts of the project, or when there is a need for independent deployment of different components</li>
        </ul>
