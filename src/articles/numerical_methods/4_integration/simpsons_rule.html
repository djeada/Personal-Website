            <h2 id="simpson-s-rule">Simpson's Rule</h2>
            <p>Simpson's Rule is a powerful technique in numerical integration, utilized for approximating definite integrals when an exact antiderivative of the function is difficult or impossible to determine analytically. This method enhances the accuracy of integral approximations by modeling the region under the function's graph as a series of parabolic segments, rather than relying solely on simpler geometric shapes like rectangles or trapezoids. By fitting quadratic polynomials to segments of the function, Simpson's Rule captures the curvature and more intricate behavior of the function, often resulting in a more precise approximation compared to other numerical methods such as the Midpoint Rule or the Trapezoidal Rule.</p>
            <p>The fundamental advantage of Simpson's Rule lies in its ability to approximate the integral by considering not just the function's values at the endpoints of each subinterval but also at the midpoint. This approach allows the method to account for the function's curvature, providing a better fit to the actual shape of the graph. Consequently, Simpson's Rule typically delivers higher accuracy with fewer subintervals, making it an efficient choice for many practical applications in engineering, physics, and other scientific disciplines where numerical integration is essential.</p>
            <h3 id="mathematical-formulation">Mathematical Formulation</h3>
            <p>The foundation of Simpson's Rule is based on estimating the integral of a function $f(x)$ over a specified interval $[a, b]$ by approximating the region under the curve with a quadratic polynomial. This polynomial is constructed to pass through three key points: the two endpoints of the interval, $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$, and the midpoint $\left(\frac{a+b}{2}, f\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)\right)$. By fitting a parabola through these points, Simpson's Rule effectively captures the curvature of the function within the interval, leading to a more accurate approximation of the integral.</p>
            <p>The basic formula to approximate the integral of $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ using Simpson's Rule is given by:</p>
            <p>$$
                \frac{b - a}{6} \left[ f(a) + 4f\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right) + f(b) \right]
                $$</p>
            <p>This formula calculates the weighted average of the function values at the endpoints and the midpoint, with the midpoint value being given four times the weight of the endpoints. The factor $\frac{b - a}{6}$ scales the sum appropriately based on the width of the interval.</p>
            <p>To extend Simpson's Rule to multiple subintervals, let $h$ represent half the width of each subinterval, defined as $h = \frac{b - a}{2}$. When the interval $[a, b]$ is divided into an even number of subintervals $N$, the approximation of the integral becomes:</p>
            <p>$$
                \int_a^b f(x) dx \approx \frac{h}{3} \sum_{k=1}^{N/2} \left[ f(x_{2k-2}) + 4f(x_{2k-1}) + f(x_{2k}) \right]
                $$</p>
            <p>In this summation, each pair of subintervals is treated together, ensuring that the number of intervals remains even. The function values are weighted accordingly, with the midpoints receiving a higher weight to account for the curvature captured by the quadratic approximation.</p>
            <p>The diagram below visualizes the concept of Simpson's Rule, illustrating how parabolic segments are fitted to the function's graph over each pair of subintervals:</p>
            <p><img alt="Simpson's Rule Visualization" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37275728/188944644-e3f47dbf-ba97-472f-8891-7e12906566d3.png" /></p>
            <p>This visual representation helps in understanding how the quadratic polynomials approximate the area under the curve, providing a more accurate estimation compared to linear approximations used in other numerical integration methods.</p>
            <h3 id="algorithm-steps">Algorithm Steps</h3>
            <p>Implementing Simpson's Rule involves a systematic series of steps to ensure an accurate approximation of the definite integral. The algorithm is straightforward yet effective, leveraging the method's ability to model the function's behavior more precisely. The following are the detailed steps involved in applying Simpson's Rule:</p>
            <p>I. <strong>Partition the Interval:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Begin by dividing the interval $[a, b]$ into an even number of subintervals, denoted by $N$. The choice of $N$ affects the accuracy of the approximation; a larger $N$ generally leads to a more precise result.</li>
                <li>Calculate the width of each subinterval using $h = \frac{b - a}{N}$. Ensuring that $N$ is even is crucial for the application of Simpson's Rule, as the method pairs subintervals for quadratic approximation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>II. <strong>Evaluate Function at Required Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>For each subinterval, determine the function values at the endpoints and the midpoints. Specifically, calculate $f(x_i)$ for $i = 0$ to $N$, where $x_i = a + ih$.</li>
                <li>These evaluations are essential for constructing the quadratic polynomials that approximate the function over each pair of subintervals.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>III. <strong>Apply Simpson's Rule Formula:</strong></p>
            <p>$$
                \int_a^b f(x) dx \approx \frac{h}{3} \left[ f(x_0) + 4 \sum_{k=1}^{N/2} f(x_{2k-1}) + 2 \sum_{k=1}^{N/2 - 1} f(x_{2k}) + f(x_N) \right]
                $$</p>
            <p>This formula accounts for the alternating weights of 4 and 2 applied to the function values at odd and even indices, respectively, ensuring that each pair of subintervals is accurately modeled by a parabola.</p>
            <p>IV. <strong>Aggregate the Results:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sum all the weighted function values as per the formula to obtain the total integral approximation.</li>
                <li>This aggregated sum represents the estimated area under the curve $f(x)$ over the interval $[a, b]$.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Simpson's Rule systematically constructs a reliable approximation of the definite integral, balancing computational efficiency with high accuracy.</p>
            <h3 id="example">Example</h3>
            <p>To illustrate the application of Simpson's Rule, consider the function $f(x) = x^2$. This example demonstrates how the method approximates the integral over a specific interval using a manageable number of subintervals.</p>
            <p>I. <strong>Choose Interval and Subdivisions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Let $a = 0$ and $b = 2$, and partition this interval into $N = 2$ equal subintervals. This choice ensures that the number of subintervals is even, as required by Simpson's Rule.</li>
                <li>The width of each subinterval is $h = \frac{2 - 0}{2} = 1$, resulting in subintervals $[0, 1]$ and $[1, 2]$.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>II. <strong>Evaluate at Required Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>$f(0) = 0^2 = 0$</li>
                <li>$f(1) = 1^2 = 1$</li>
                <li>$f(2) = 2^2 = 4$</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These evaluations provide the necessary data points for applying Simpson's Rule.</p>
            <p>III. <strong>Apply Simpson's Rule Formula:</strong></p>
            <p>$$
                \frac{b - a}{6} \left[ f(a) + 4f\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right) + f(b) \right] = \frac{2 - 0}{6} \left[ f(0) + 4f(1) + f(2) \right] = \frac{2}{6} \left[ 0 + 4(1) + 4 \right] = \frac{2}{6} \times 8 = \frac{16}{6} = \frac{8}{3}
                $$</p>
            <p>This calculation yields an approximate value of $\frac{8}{3}$ for the integral.</p>
            <p>IV. <strong>Compare with Exact Integral:</strong></p>
            <p>$$
                \int_{0}^{2} x^2 dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_0^2 = \frac{8}{3} - 0 = \frac{8}{3}
                $$</p>
            <p>In this case, Simpson's Rule provides an exact approximation, demonstrating its effectiveness for polynomial functions of degree two or lower.</p>
            <h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When compared to the Rectangle (Midpoint) Rule and the Trapezoidal Rule, the method often yields a more <em>accurate approximation</em> of definite integrals. This increased accuracy comes from using quadratic polynomials to model the functionâ€™s behavior, allowing it to capture curvature and more complex features. For smooth functions that can be closely approximated by parabolas over each pair of subintervals, the method can achieve exact results with <em>fewer subintervals</em> than other approaches. This efficiency is especially useful in computational applications where reducing the number of function evaluations saves significant processing time.</li>
                <li>The method is straightforward to understand and implement, making it accessible to students. It requires only <em>basic arithmetic operations</em> and function evaluations at specific points, without the need for complex algorithms or iterative procedures. Its simplicity allows for quick coding and seamless integration into larger numerical computation frameworks, facilitating its use across a wide range of scientific and engineering problems.</li>
                <li>It is particularly effective for functions that are well-approximated by <em>parabolas</em> over small intervals. This makes the method ideal for integrating <em>polynomial functions of degree two or lower</em>, as well as other smooth functions where a quadratic approximation is sufficiently accurate. By capturing the essential curvature of such functions, it minimizes the error associated with linear approximations, yielding more reliable results.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The method requires that the interval $a, b$ be divided into an <em>even number of subintervals</em>. This can be inconvenient when the available data points do not naturally align with an even partitioning. If an odd number of subintervals is initially chosen, users must adjust by either adding an extra subinterval or applying a different technique for the final piece, which complicates the implementation.</li>
                <li>Its reliance on <em>quadratic polynomials</em> means it performs best for functions that closely resemble parabolas within each pair of subintervals. For functions with significant higher-order curvature or behaviors not well captured by parabolic fits, it may produce large errors. In such cases, the approximation can be misleading unless the suitability of the method is carefully assessed relative to the functionâ€™s characteristics.</li>
                <li>Functions exhibiting rapid changes, oscillations, or <em>discontinuities</em> within the integration interval pose challenges. A single quadratic fit over each pair of subintervals may not capture sudden variations or sharp transitions, leading to substantial errors. For piecewise-defined functions, those with vertical asymptotes, or abrupt slope changes, the method can require an impractically large number of subintervals to reach acceptable accuracy, negating its computational advantages.</li>
                <li>Like all numerical methods, it is subject to <em>numerical stability</em> issues and round-off errorsâ€”particularly when working with very large or very small intervals or limited numerical precision. Error accumulation can compromise the approximationâ€™s integrity, sometimes necessitating higher-precision arithmetic to mitigate these effects.</li>
                <li>The method is designed for definite integrals over <em>finite intervals</em> and is not inherently suited to improper integralsâ€”those with infinite integration limits or integrand singularities. Applying it to such problems demands additional techniques or adaptations, which can complicate the process and diminish its overall effectiveness.</li>
