            <h2 id="simpson-s-rule">Simpson's Rule</h2>
            <p>Simpson's Rule is a powerful technique in numerical integration, utilized for approximating definite integrals when an exact antiderivative of the function is difficult or impossible to determine analytically. This method enhances the accuracy of integral approximations by modeling the region under the function's graph as a series of parabolic segments, rather than relying solely on simpler geometric shapes like rectangles or trapezoids. By fitting quadratic polynomials to segments of the function, Simpson's Rule captures the curvature and more intricate behavior of the function, often resulting in a more precise approximation compared to other numerical methods such as the Midpoint Rule or the Trapezoidal Rule.</p>
            <p>The fundamental advantage of Simpson's Rule lies in its ability to approximate the integral by considering not just the function's values at the endpoints of each subinterval but also at the midpoint. This approach allows the method to account for the function's curvature, providing a better fit to the actual shape of the graph. Consequently, Simpson's Rule typically delivers higher accuracy with fewer subintervals, making it an efficient choice for many practical applications in engineering, physics, and other scientific disciplines where numerical integration is essential.</p>
            <h3 id="mathematical-formulation">Mathematical Formulation</h3>
            <p>The foundation of Simpson's Rule is based on estimating the integral of a function $f(x)$ over a specified interval $[a, b]$ by approximating the region under the curve with a quadratic polynomial. This polynomial is constructed to pass through three key points: the two endpoints of the interval, $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$, and the midpoint $\left(\frac{a+b}{2}, f\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)\right)$. By fitting a parabola through these points, Simpson's Rule effectively captures the curvature of the function within the interval, leading to a more accurate approximation of the integral.</p>
            <p>The basic formula to approximate the integral of $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ using Simpson's Rule is given by:</p>
            <p>$$
                \frac{b - a}{6} \left[ f(a) + 4f\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right) + f(b) \right]
                $$</p>
            <p>This formula calculates the weighted average of the function values at the endpoints and the midpoint, with the midpoint value being given four times the weight of the endpoints. The factor $\frac{b - a}{6}$ scales the sum appropriately based on the width of the interval.</p>
            <p>To extend Simpson's Rule to multiple subintervals, let $h$ represent half the width of each subinterval, defined as $h = \frac{b - a}{2}$. When the interval $[a, b]$ is divided into an even number of subintervals $N$, the approximation of the integral becomes:</p>
            <p>$$
                \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \approx \frac{h}{3} \sum_{k=1}^{N/2} \left[ f(x_{2k-2}) + 4f(x_{2k-1}) + f(x_{2k}) \right]
                $$</p>
            <p>In this summation, each pair of subintervals is treated together, ensuring that the number of intervals remains even. The function values are weighted accordingly, with the midpoints receiving a higher weight to account for the curvature captured by the quadratic approximation.</p>
            <p>The diagram below visualizes the concept of Simpson's Rule, illustrating how parabolic segments are fitted to the function's graph over each pair of subintervals:</p>
            <p><img alt="Simpson's Rule Visualization" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37275728/188944644-e3f47dbf-ba97-472f-8891-7e12906566d3.png" /></p>
            <p>This visual representation helps in understanding how the quadratic polynomials approximate the area under the curve, providing a more accurate estimation compared to linear approximations used in other numerical integration methods.</p>
            <h3 id="algorithm-steps">Algorithm Steps</h3>
            <p>Implementing Simpson's Rule involves a systematic series of steps to ensure an accurate approximation of the definite integral. The algorithm is straightforward yet effective, leveraging the method's ability to model the function's behavior more precisely. The following are the detailed steps involved in applying Simpson's Rule:</p>
            <p>I. <strong>Partition the Interval:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Begin by dividing the interval $[a, b]$ into an even number of subintervals, denoted by $N$. The choice of $N$ affects the accuracy of the approximation; a larger $N$ generally leads to a more precise result.</li>
                <li>Calculate the width of each subinterval using $h = \frac{b - a}{N}$. Ensuring that $N$ is even is crucial for the application of Simpson's Rule, as the method pairs subintervals for quadratic approximation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>II. <strong>Evaluate Function at Required Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>For each subinterval, determine the function values at the endpoints and the midpoints. Specifically, calculate $f(x_i)$ for $i = 0$ to $N$, where $x_i = a + ih$.</li>
                <li>These evaluations are essential for constructing the quadratic polynomials that approximate the function over each pair of subintervals.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>III. <strong>Apply Simpson's Rule Formula:</strong></p>
            <p>$$
                \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \approx \frac{h}{3} \left[ f(x_0) + 4 \sum_{k=1}^{N/2} f(x_{2k-1}) + 2 \sum_{k=1}^{N/2 - 1} f(x_{2k}) + f(x_N) \right]
                $$</p>
            <p>This formula accounts for the alternating weights of 4 and 2 applied to the function values at odd and even indices, respectively, ensuring that each pair of subintervals is accurately modeled by a parabola.</p>
            <p>IV. <strong>Aggregate the Results:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sum all the weighted function values as per the formula to obtain the total integral approximation.</li>
                <li>This aggregated sum represents the estimated area under the curve $f(x)$ over the interval $[a, b]$.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By meticulously following these steps, Simpson's Rule systematically constructs a reliable approximation of the definite integral, balancing computational efficiency with high accuracy.</p>
            <h3 id="example">Example</h3>
            <p>To illustrate the application of Simpson's Rule, consider the function $f(x) = x^2$. This example demonstrates how the method approximates the integral over a specific interval using a manageable number of subintervals.</p>
            <p>I. <strong>Choose Interval and Subdivisions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Let $a = 0$ and $b = 2$, and partition this interval into $N = 2$ equal subintervals. This choice ensures that the number of subintervals is even, as required by Simpson's Rule.</li>
                <li>The width of each subinterval is $h = \frac{2 - 0}{2} = 1$, resulting in subintervals $[0, 1]$ and $[1, 2]$.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>II. <strong>Evaluate at Required Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>$f(0) = 0^2 = 0$</li>
                <li>$f(1) = 1^2 = 1$</li>
                <li>$f(2) = 2^2 = 4$</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These evaluations provide the necessary data points for applying Simpson's Rule.</p>
            <p>III. <strong>Apply Simpson's Rule Formula:</strong></p>
            <p>$$
                \frac{b - a}{6} \left[ f(a) + 4f\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right) + f(b) \right] = \frac{2 - 0}{6} \left[ f(0) + 4f(1) + f(2) \right] = \frac{2}{6} \left[ 0 + 4(1) + 4 \right] = \frac{2}{6} \times 8 = \frac{16}{6} = \frac{8}{3}
                $$</p>
            <p>This calculation yields an approximate value of $\frac{8}{3}$ for the integral.</p>
            <p>IV. <strong>Compare with Exact Integral:</strong></p>
            <p>$$
                \int_{0}^{2} x^2 \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_0^2 = \frac{8}{3} - 0 = \frac{8}{3}
                $$</p>
            <p>In this case, Simpson's Rule provides an exact approximation, demonstrating its effectiveness for polynomial functions of degree two or lower.</p>
            <p>This example highlights how Simpson's Rule accurately approximates integrals, especially when the function being integrated is well-represented by quadratic polynomials within each subinterval. The method's precision in this scenario underscores its utility in numerical integration tasks.</p>
            <h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When compared to the Rectangle (Midpoint) Rule and the Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson's Rule often yields a more <strong>accurate</strong> approximation of definite integrals. This increased accuracy is primarily due to the method's use of quadratic polynomials to model the function's behavior, allowing it to capture the curvature and more complex features of the function. For functions that are smooth and can be closely approximated by parabolas within each pair of subintervals, Simpson's Rule can achieve exact results with fewer <strong>subintervals</strong> than other methods. This efficiency is particularly beneficial in computational applications where reducing the number of function evaluations can save significant processing time.</li>
                <li>Simpson's Rule is straightforward to <strong>understand</strong> and implement, making it accessible to students and practitioners alike. The method requires only basic arithmetic operations and function evaluations at specific points, without the need for complex algorithms or iterative procedures. Its simplicity allows for quick coding and integration into larger numerical computation frameworks, facilitating its use in a wide range of scientific and engineering problems.</li>
                <li>The method is particularly effective for functions that are well-approximated by <strong>parabolas</strong> over small intervals. This makes Simpson's Rule ideal for integrating polynomial functions of degree two or lower, as well as other smooth functions where the quadratic approximation is sufficiently accurate. By capturing the essential curvature of such functions, Simpson's Rule minimizes the error associated with linear approximations, leading to more reliable results.</li>
                <li>Simpson's Rule strikes a balance between computational <strong>efficiency</strong> and accuracy. While it provides higher accuracy than simpler methods, it does so without requiring excessive computational resources. This balance makes it suitable for applications where both precision and speed are important considerations. The method's ability to deliver accurate results with a relatively small number of subintervals contributes to its practicality in real-world scenarios where computational power may be limited.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Simpson's Rule necessitates that the interval $[a, b]$ be divided into an <strong>even</strong> number of subintervals. This requirement can be inconvenient in situations where the number of available data points does not naturally align with an even partitioning. In cases where an odd number of subintervals is initially chosen, users must adjust by either adding an extra subinterval or employing alternative methods for the final subinterval, complicating the implementation process.</li>
                <li>The method's reliance on quadratic <strong>polynomials</strong> means that it performs best for functions that closely resemble parabolas within each pair of subintervals. For functions with significant higher-order curvature or those that exhibit behaviors not well-captured by parabolic approximations, Simpson's Rule may fail to provide accurate results. In such cases, the approximation error can be substantial, leading to misleading conclusions if not properly accounted for. Users must assess the suitability of Simpson's Rule based on the characteristics of the function being integrated.</li>
                <li>Functions that display rapid changes, oscillations, or <strong>discontinuities</strong> within the interval of integration pose challenges for Simpson's Rule. The method's single quadratic approximation over each pair of subintervals may not adequately capture sudden variations or sharp transitions, resulting in large approximation errors. In scenarios involving piecewise-defined functions, functions with vertical asymptotes, or those with abrupt changes in slope, Simpson's Rule may require an impractically large number of subintervals to achieve acceptable accuracy, negating its computational efficiency advantages.</li>
                <li>Like all numerical methods, Simpson's Rule is susceptible to numerical <strong>stability</strong> issues and round-off errors, especially when dealing with very large or very small intervals, or when performing computations with limited numerical precision. Accumulation of such errors can compromise the integrity of the integral approximation, necessitating careful numerical analysis and, in some cases, the use of higher-precision arithmetic to mitigate their impact.</li>
                <li>Simpson's Rule is primarily designed for definite integrals over <strong>finite</strong> intervals. It is not inherently equipped to handle improper integrals, where the interval of integration is infinite or the integrand has singularities within the interval. Applying Simpson's Rule to such integrals requires additional techniques or modifications, which can complicate the process and reduce the method's overall effectiveness.</li>
