            <h2 id="performance-monitoring">Performance Monitoring</h2>
            <p>Performance monitoring is an important aspect of system administration as it allows you to identify any potential bottlenecks or issues that may be affecting the performance of your system. In this article, we will explore some of the tools and techniques available for monitoring performance in Linux.</p>
            <h2 id="the-top-command">The top command</h2>
            <p>The top command is a real-time system monitoring tool that allows you to view the resource usage of various processes running on your system. It provides a detailed overview of the CPU, memory, and swap usage, as well as the load average and uptime of your system.</p>
            <p>You can run it without any flags and arguments:</p>
            <p><code>top</code></p>
            <p>This will display a list of processes sorted by CPU usage, with the highest usage at the top. You can use the <code>Shift + m</code> key combination to sort the processes by memory usage instead.</p>
            <p>You can also use the <code>-p</code> flag to specify a specific process ID to monitor:</p>
            <p><code>top -p 1234</code></p>
            <h2 id="swap-space">Swap space</h2>
            <p>Swap space is an area on your hard drive that is used as virtual memory when your system runs out of physical RAM. It allows your system to continue running even when it has exhausted all available RAM, but it can have a negative impact on performance as accessing data from the hard drive is slower than accessing it from RAM.</p>
            <p>To view the amount of swap space available on your system, use the free command:</p>
            <p><code>free -h</code></p>
            <p>This will display the total, used, and free swap space in human-readable format (e.g. in MB or GB).</p>
            <p><code>Free</code> will display the total amount of RAM available, as well as the amount of used and free memory. If the used memory is close to the total amount of RAM, it may indicate that you are running out of RAM and may need to add more or optimize your usage.</p>
            <h2 id="monitor-ram-usage">Monitor RAM usage</h2>
            <p>RSS (Resident Set Size) is used to indicate how much memory a process is currently using. It does not include swap memory and includes the entire stack and heap memory. Memory from shared libraries is included as long as the pages from those libraries are physically present in memory. However, some of the memory is shared, so other applications may use it, which means that adding up all of the RSS numbers may result in more RAM than your machine actually has.</p>
            <p>VSZ (Virtual Set Size) is the memory size allocated to a process when it is first executed. It consists of all memory that the process may access, including swapped out memory, allocated but not used memory, and memory from shared libraries.</p>
            <p>For example, let's say we have a process that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Currently has 450K of its own binary, 800K of shared libraries loaded, and 120K of stack/heap allocation in memory</li>
                <li>Initially started with 600K reserved binaries, 2200K of shared libraries, and 150K of stack/heap allocations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>a) RSS: 450K + 800K + 120K = 1370K</p>
            <p>b) VSZ: 600K + 2200K + 150K = 2950K</p>
            <p>To find the 10 processes that are using the most RAM, use the following command:</p>
            <p><code>ps -e -o pid,vsz,comm= | sort -n -k 2 -r | head 10</code></p>
            <h2 id="the-vmstat-command">The vmstat command</h2>
            <p><code>vmstat</code> displays information about system memory, swap, and CPU usage. It provides a snapshot of the current state of the system, as well as the average statistics over a period of time.</p>
            <p>To view the current state of the system, use <code>vmstat</code> without any arguments. To view the average statistics over a period of time, use <code>vmstat [interval] [count]</code>, where interval is the time in seconds between each snapshot and count is the number of snapshots to take.</p>
            <h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>What command can you use to view the current CPU, memory, and swap usage in real-time?</li>
                <li>How can you determine if your machine is running low on available memory?</li>
                <li>What command can you use to view information about CPU and memory usage over time?</li>
                <li>How can you identify which process is consuming the most CPU or memory resources on your system?</li>
                <li>What are some common signs that a machine is reaching its limits in terms of CPU, memory, or disk usage?</li>
