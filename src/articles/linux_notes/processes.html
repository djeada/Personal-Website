            <h2 id="processes">Processes</h2>
            <p>In any operating system, a process is the fundamental unit of execution—a live instance of a program. Beyond its executable code (the text segment), a process encompasses its dynamic state: the program counter, CPU registers, call stack, heap, and other variable storage. To manage and schedule these tasks, the OS assigns each process a unique process identifier (PID).</p>
            <p>When a user executes a command, launches an application, or initiates a system service, a new process is instantiated. Modern computing systems, with their powerful processors, can handle a multitude of processes at the same time. This parallel execution is managed through a technique known as rapid context switching, where the operating system's scheduler assigns CPU time slices to each process and switches between them so quickly that it gives the illusion of simultaneous execution.</p>
            <p>In the context of multicore CPUs, each core can handle its own set of processes independently. This multi-core processing enables even more efficient and faster handling of multiple processes.</p>
            <p>Processes in a system can be broadly categorized into two types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>Shell Job</strong> refers to a process started from a user's command line interface or shell. It is typically interactive, requiring user input and providing output directly to the user's console. Examples of shell jobs include editing a document in a text editor or running a custom script.</li>
                <li>In contrast, a <strong>Daemon</strong> is a background process that usually starts at system boot and runs with elevated privileges. Daemons do not interact directly with the user interface; instead, they operate silently in the background, handling various system-related tasks. Common examples include the print spooler daemon, which manages print jobs, and the network daemon, which handles network connections.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="process-management-commands">Process Management Commands</h3>
            <p>Process management is integral to system administration. The <code>ps</code> and <code>top</code> commands are pivotal for this purpose.</p>
            <h4 id="the-ps-command">The <code>ps</code> Command</h4>
            <p>The <code>ps</code> command displays information about active processes. Here are some variants of the command:</p>
            <p>I. Basic Process Listing</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">ps -ef</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>This outputs a list of all currently running processes, showing the process ID (PID), terminal associated with the process (TTY), CPU time (TIME), and the executable name (CMD).</p>
            <p>Sample Output:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-shell">UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root         1     0  0 03:15 ?        00:00:01 /sbin/init
...</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>II. Detailed Process Information</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-shell">ps -e --format uid,pid,ppid,%cpu,cmd</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>This provides detailed information including User ID (UID), Process ID (PID), Parent Process ID (PPID), CPU usage (%CPU), and the command path (CMD).</p>
            <p>Sample Output:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-shell">UID     PID  PPID %CPU CMD
1000   2176  2145  0.0 /usr/bin/bash
...</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>III. Enhanced Process Summaries</p>
            <p>One option:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-shell">ps aux</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>This gives a condensed summary of all active processes, including details like user, PID, CPU, and memory usage.</p>
            <p>Sample Output:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-shell">USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root         1  0.0  0.1 169560  5892 ?        Ss   Apr10   0:01 /sbin/init
...</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>Another option:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-shell">ps fax</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>This displays the process hierarchy in a tree structure, showing parent-child relationships.</p>
            <p>Sample Output:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-shell">PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
  2 ?        S      0:00 [kthreadd]
/-+- 3951 ?        S      0:07  \_ [kworker/u8:2]
...</code></pre>
            </div>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-shell">ps -o</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>Customizes the output by specifying column names, tailored for specific requirements.</p>
            <h4 id="the-top-command">The <code>top</code> Command</h4>
            <p>For real-time process monitoring, top is used:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-top"></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>This shows a dynamic list of processes, usually sorted by CPU usage. It includes system summary information (like CPU and memory usage) and a detailed list of processes.</p>
            <p>Sample Output:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-shell">top - 03:16:10 up 1 day,  6:37,  2 users,  load average: 1.20, 0.45, 0.15

            </div>
            <h3 id="process-life-cycle">Process life cycle</h3>
            <p>The life cycle of a process in an operating system is a critical concept. The provided diagram illustrates the various stages a process goes through:</p>
            <p><img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed119dd8-90c7-4f01-9c0b-e8268771876d" /></p>
            <ul>
                <li>When a process is <strong>Created</strong>, it enters the system and is allocated the necessary resources, but it has not yet started running.</li>
                <li>In the <strong>Running</strong> state, the process is actively executing instructions on the CPU.</li>
                <li>A process can be <strong>Interrupted</strong>, meaning it is temporarily stopped. This may occur to allow other processes to run or because the process is waiting for an input or an event.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Exit</strong> state indicates that the process has completed its execution and is ready to be removed from the system.</li>
                <li>If a process is <strong>Terminated</strong>, it means that an error occurred or an explicit kill command was issued, resulting in the process being forcefully stopped.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="process-spawning">Process Spawning</h3>
            <p>Process spawning is a fundamental aspect of any operating system. It's the action of creating a new process from an existing one. Whether it's running a command from a terminal or a process creating another, spawning processes is a routine operation in system workflows.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first process that initiates when a system boots up is assigned Process ID (PID) 1. </li>
                <li>This initial process is known as <code>systemd</code> or <code>init</code>, based on the Linux distribution in use. </li>
                <li>Being the first process, it acts as the parent to all subsequently spawned processes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Spawning a process can be as straightforward as executing a command or running a program from the command line. For instance:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">echo "Hello, world!"</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>This command creates a new process that executes the echo command, resulting in the specified text being printed on the terminal.</p>
            <p>For more complex operations, you might need to spawn processes programmatically. In the C programming language, the fork and exec functions are frequently used for this purpose.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>fork()</code> creates a copy of the currently executing process, generating a new child process.</li>
                <li><code>exec()</code> replaces the current process with a new one.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Consider the following example:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-clike">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main() {
  pid_t pid = fork();
  if (pid == 0) {
    // This is the child process
    exec("/bin/ls");
  } else {
    // This is the parent process
    printf("Child process ID: %d\n", pid);
  }
  return 0;
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>In this program, a new process is created using the fork function, which then gets replaced by the <code>ls</code> command via the exec function. The parent process simply prints the child process ID on the terminal.</p>
            <p>There are several other methods to spawn processes in Linux. Functions like <code>system</code>, <code>popen</code>, or <code>posix_spawn</code> from the POSIX library also provide process spawning capabilities.</p>
            <h3 id="process-termination">Process Termination</h3>
            <p>To manage system resources effectively, it is sometimes necessary to terminate running processes. Depending on your needs, this can be accomplished in several ways.</p>
            <h4 id="terminating-processes-by-pid">Terminating Processes by PID</h4>
            <p>Each process, upon its creation, is assigned a unique Process ID (PID). To stop a process using its PID, the <code>kill</code> command is used. For instance:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">kill 12345</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>In this example, a termination signal is sent to the process with PID 12345, instructing it to stop execution.</p>
            <h4 id="terminating-processes-by-name">Terminating Processes by Name</h4>
            <p>If you don't know a process's PID, but you do know its name, the <code>pkill</code> command is handy. This command allows you to stop a process using its name:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">pkill process_name</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>In this case, a termination signal is sent to all processes that share the specified name, effectively halting their execution.</p>
            <h4 id="specifying-termination-signals">Specifying Termination Signals</h4>
            <p>The <code>kill</code> and <code>pkill</code> commands provide the option to specify the type of signal sent to a process. For example, to send a SIGINT signal (equivalent to Ctrl+C), you can use:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">kill -SIGINT 12345</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>Linux supports a variety of signals, each designed for a specific purpose. Some common signals include:</p>
            <p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Signal</td>
                    <td>Value</td>
                    <td>Description</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>SIGHUP</code></td>
                    <td>(1)</td>
                    <td>Hangup detected on controlling terminal or death of controlling process</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>SIGINT</code></td>
                    <td>(2)</td>
                    <td>Interrupt from keyboard; typically, caused by <code>Ctrl+C</code></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>SIGKILL</code></td>
                    <td>(9)</td>
                    <td>Forces immediate process termination; it cannot be ignored, blocked, or caught</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>SIGSTOP</code></td>
                    <td>(19)</td>
                    <td>Pauses the process; cannot be ignored</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>SIGCONT</code></td>
                    <td>(18)</td>
                    <td>Resumes paused process</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            </p>
            <p>Terminating processes should be performed with caution. Some processes may be critical for system operation or hold valuable data that could be lost upon abrupt termination. Therefore, it's advisable to use commands such as <code>ps</code> and <code>top</code> to observe currently running processes before attempting to stop any of them. This approach allows for more controlled and careful system management, preventing unintended disruptions or data loss.</p>
            <h4 id="special-pid-values-in-kill">Special PID Values in <code>kill</code></h4>
            <p>When using the <code>kill</code> command, special PID values can be used to target multiple processes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using <strong><code>-1</code></strong> as a signal target sends the signal to all processes that the user has permission to signal, excluding the process itself and process ID 1 (the init process).</li>
                <li>The <strong><code>0</code></strong> target sends the signal to all processes in the same process group as the calling process, allowing for group-wide signaling.</li>
                <li>When <strong>negative values less than -1</strong> are used, the signal is sent to all processes in the process group corresponding to the absolute value of the given number. For example, executing <code>kill -2 -SIGTERM</code> sends the SIGTERM signal to all processes in the process group with PGID 2.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These special values allow for more flexible management of processes and process groups, especially in scenarios where you need to signal multiple related processes at once. Here are examples of using these special values:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash"># Sending SIGTERM to all processes the user can signal

kill 0 -SIGTERM

# Sending SIGTERM to all processes in the process group with PGID 2

            <p>When you kick off a command in a shell, it either <em>grabs the terminal</em> (foreground) or quietly keeps working behind the scenes (background). Knowing how to juggle the two is essential for multitasking without spawning extra terminals.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When a process is running as a <strong>Foreground Process</strong>, it actively executes and interacts with the terminal's input and output. These are typically tasks that the user has initiated and is directly interacting with in the terminal.</li>
                <li>In contrast, a <strong>Background Process</strong> operates without direct interaction with the terminal's input and output. This functionality enables users to run multiple processes at the same time, allowing them to initiate new tasks without waiting for the completion of others.</li>
