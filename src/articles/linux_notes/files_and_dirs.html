            <h2 id="understanding-files-and-directories">Understanding Files and Directories</h2>
            <p>One of the fundamental skills is to navigate and manage files and directories effectively. Here, we focus on the crucial concepts that will facilitate your work within the file system.</p>
            <h3 id="types-of-file-paths">Types of File Paths</h3>
            <p>The two main types of paths are <strong>Absolute Path</strong> and <strong>Relative Path</strong>. </p>
            <h4 id="absolute-path">Absolute Path</h4>
            <p>An <strong>absolute path</strong> specifies the complete location of a file or directory from the root directory, indicated by a forward slash (<code>/</code>). It provides the full pathway from the root to the target file or directory, making it independent of the current working directory. As a result, absolute paths remain consistent regardless of the user's current position within the file system.</p>
            <p>Example of Absolute Path:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">/home/user/notes/file_name.txt</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>This path directs to the file <code>file_name.txt</code> located in the <code>notes</code> directory, which is under the <code>user</code> directory within the <code>home</code> directory, starting from the root of the file system (<code>/</code>).</p>
            <h4 id="relative-path">Relative Path</h4>
            <p>A <strong>relative path</strong> describes the location of a file or directory based on the current working directory. Unlike absolute paths, relative paths do not start from the root. Instead, they specify the path from the user's current location in the file system.</p>
            <p>Example of Relative Path:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">notes/file_name.txt</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>This path points to the file <code>file_name.txt</code> located in the <code>notes</code> directory under the current working directory.</p>
            <p>Key Differences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Absolute paths provide a consistent and unchanging route to a file or directory, useful for scripts or commands that need to run regardless of the current directory. In contrast, relative paths offer flexibility and brevity, which can be advantageous when navigating within a specific directory hierarchy.</li>
                <li>While absolute paths reduce the risk of errors due to their clarity and specificity, relative paths require careful handling as they depend on the user's current location within the file system. Therefore, absolute paths are often preferred for their reliability, whereas relative paths are convenient for quick access within a known directory structure.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="navigation-and-file-manipulation">Navigation and File Manipulation</h3>
            <p>Linux provides several commands to navigate through the file system and manipulate files and directories. Here are a few fundamental commands:</p>
            <h3 id="print-working-directory-pwd-">Print Working Directory (<code>pwd</code>)</h3>
            <p>The <code>pwd</code> command displays the absolute path of the current directory.</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">pwd</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <h4 id="change-directory-cd-">Change Directory (cd)</h4>
            <p>The cd command allows you to change your current working directory.</p>
            <p>To move to a different directory, specify its path:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">cd /path/to/directory</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>To navigate to your home directory, use:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">cd ~</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <h4 id="list-directory-contents-ls-">List Directory Contents (ls)</h4>
            <p>The ls command lists the contents of a directory.</p>
            <p>To view the directory's contents, use:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">ls</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>For a more detailed listing, including hidden files and additional information (file permissions, the number of links, the owner, the size, and the last modification date), use:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">ls -al</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>To display specific file groups using wildcards, for example, to list all .txt files in the /home/mydirectory directory, use:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">ls /home/mydirectory/*.txt</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <h3 id="managing-files-and-directories">Managing Files and Directories</h3>
            <p>Working with files and directories is a key aspect of Linux. Various commands facilitate the creation, manipulation, and inspection of these resources. </p>
            <h4 id="creating-files-and-directories">Creating Files and Directories</h4>
            <p>In Linux, you can use the <code>touch</code> command to create an empty file. For example, to create a new file named <code>sample.txt</code>, you would type:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">touch sample.txt</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>Creating a new directory involves the mkdir command. To create a directory called example_dir, you would run:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir example_dir</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <h4 id="copying-files-and-directories">Copying Files and Directories</h4>
            <p>The cp command is employed to copy files and directories from one location to another. For instance, to copy a file named file.txt to a directory named directory, you would use:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">cp file.txt directory/</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>If you need to copy a directory and its contents, the -r (recursive) option is crucial:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">cp -r source_dir destination_dir</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>There are several options that can modify the behavior of cp:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <code>-a</code> option, also known as the archive option, preserves file attributes and symbolic links within the copied directories.</li>
                <li>The <code>-v</code> option, known as the verbose option, provides detailed output of the operation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="moving-and-renaming-files-and-directories">Moving and Renaming Files and Directories</h4>
            <p>The mv command helps with moving or renaming files and directories. To rename a file from oldname.txt to newname.txt, you would execute:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">mv oldname.txt newname.txt</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>The same mv command helps you move a file from one directory to another. For instance, to move file.txt from the current directory to another directory called dir1, you would use:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">mv file.txt dir1/</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <h4 id="removing-files-and-directories">Removing Files and Directories</h4>
            <p>Files and directories can be removed with the rm command. To remove a file named file.txt, you would type:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">rm file.txt</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>To remove an entire directory and its contents, you need to include the -r (recursive) option:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">rm -r directory_name</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>Warning: The rm command is powerful and potentially destructive, especially when used with the -r (recursive) and -f (force) options. Use it with caution.</p>
            <h3 id="viewing-and-inspecting-file-contents">Viewing and Inspecting File Contents</h3>
            <p>There are various ways to view and inspect the contents of files in Unix-like operating systems. We can use the <code>cat</code>, <code>more</code>, <code>less</code>, <code>head</code>, and <code>tail</code> commands to achieve this. </p>
            <h4 id="displaying-file-content-with-cat">Displaying File Content with <code>cat</code></h4>
            <p>The <code>cat</code> (concatenate) command is a standard tool used to display the entire contents of a file. It writes the contents of a file to standard output (the terminal). For instance, to display the content of a file named <code>file.txt</code>, use the following command:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">cat file.txt</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>However, keep in mind that cat is not ideal for large files because it dumps all content to the terminal at once.</p>
            <h4 id="paginating-file-content-with-more-and-less">Paginating File Content with more and less</h4>
            <p>For more manageable file viewing, particularly for larger files, the more and less commands are useful. They display content page by page, making it easier to digest.</p>
            <p>The more command shows the content of a file, pausing after each screenful:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">more file.txt</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, the less command, which is a more advanced and flexible version of more, allows both forward and backward navigation through the file:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">less file.txt</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>While viewing files with more or less, you can use these commands:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <code>Enter</code> command moves forward by one line.</li>
                <li>The <code>Space</code> command moves forward by one page.</li>
                <li>The <code>b</code> command moves one page backward, applicable in the "less" pager only.</li>
                <li>The <code>q</code> command quits the pager, usable in both "more" and "less" pagers.</li>
                <li>The <code>/pattern</code> command searches for the next occurrence of the specified text "pattern," available in the "less" pager only.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="viewing-file-parts-with-head-and-tail">Viewing File Parts with head and tail</h4>
            <p>The head and tail commands are designed to output the beginning and the end of files, respectively.</p>
            <p>The head command outputs the first part of files. It writes the first ten lines of each file to standard output. If more than one file is specified, it precedes each set of output with a header identifying the file. For instance, to display the first ten lines of file.txt, use:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">head file.txt</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>Conversely, the tail command outputs the last part of files. It writes the last ten lines of each file to standard output. If more than one file is specified, it precedes each set of output with a header identifying the file. For instance, to display the last ten lines of file.txt, use:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">tail file.txt</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>The number of lines can be adjusted using the -n option followed by the desired number of lines. For example, to view the last 20 lines of file.txt, you would use:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">tail -n 20 file.txt</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <h3 id="file-name-expansion-techniques">File Name Expansion Techniques</h3>
            <p>Brace expansion and globs are powerful tools in Linux for dealing with filenames that conform to certain patterns or templates. They are conceptually different and serve different purposes, but both can be used to save time and effort when working with files.</p>
            <h4 id="brace-expansion">Brace Expansion</h4>
            <p>Brace expansion is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated. It uses a list of comma-separated values enclosed in curly braces with an optional preamble and postscript for each value.</p>
            <p>For instance, the following command will print the strings 'abd' and 'acd':</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">$ echo a{b,c}d
abd acd</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>In this case, 'a{b,c}d' is expanded into 'abd' and 'acd', which are both echoed by the command.</p>
            <h4 id="globs">Globs</h4>
            <p>Globs, on the other hand, serve to match existing filenames. They employ wildcard characters such as * and ? to represent patterns in filenames. This can be extremely handy when performing operations on multiple files with similar names or extensions using commands like ls or cp. For instance, the glob *.txt will match all files in the current directory with a .txt extension.</p>
            <p>While brace expansion generates a list of strings based on a provided pattern, globs match and retrieve names of actual existing files.</p>
            <h4 id="comparison-to-regular-expressions">Comparison to Regular Expressions</h4>
            <p>It's important to note that wildcard characters in globs interpret differently from their counterparts in regular expressions (regex).</p>
            <p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Wildcard</td>
                    <td>Globs Description</td>
                    <td>Regex Description</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>*</code></td>
                    <td>Matches any number of characters</td>
                    <td>Matches any number of preceding element</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>?</code></td>
                    <td>Matches any single character</td>
                    <td>Makes preceding element optional</td>
                    <td></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>.</code></td>
                    <td>Matches dot as a literal character</td>
                    <td>Matches any single character</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            </p>
            <p>In globs, the * character matches any number of characters, and the ? character matches any single character. On the contrary, in regex, * matches any number of the preceding element and ? makes the preceding element optional.</p>
            <p>Understanding the subtle differences and capabilities of brace expansions, globs, and regular expressions can greatly improve your proficiency and efficiency when operating in the Linux command line environment.</p>

                <li>Construct a temporary directory in your home directory. Create three empty files in the temporary directory using the <code>touch</code> command. Use the <code>ls</code> command and redirect its output into each of these files. Then, display the contents of the files on the terminal.</li>
                <li>Replicate the entire contents of the <code>temp</code> directory to your home directory. Explain the options you used with the <code>cp</code> command to accomplish this.</li>
                <li>Create another temporary directory in your home directory. Generate three text files in this temporary directory and redirect some text into each file using the <code>&gt;</code> operator. Now, move this temporary directory to a new location. Discuss the steps you took to complete this task.</li>
                <li>Practice employing globs to match against the names of existing files. For example, construct a command that will display all files in your current directory with filenames consisting of exactly five characters. Discuss how you crafted your glob pattern to achieve this.</li>
