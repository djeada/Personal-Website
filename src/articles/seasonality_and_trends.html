            <h2 id="seasonality-and-trends">Seasonality and Trends</h2>
            <p>Seasonality and trends are common components of time series data that can impact the analysis and forecasting. Understanding these components is essential for selecting the appropriate model and improving forecast accuracy.</p>
            <h3 id="seasonality">Seasonality</h3>
            <p>Seasonality refers to periodic patterns that repeat at regular intervals in a time series. Examples of seasonal patterns include daily temperature fluctuations, weekly sales patterns, or annual fluctuations in stock prices. Seasonal patterns can be either additive or multiplicative.</p>
            <h4>Decomposing Seasonality</h4>
            <p>To analyze and remove seasonality, a time series can be decomposed into its components: trend, seasonal, and residual (also known as irregular or noise). Common decomposition methods include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Moving average: A centered moving average can be used to estimate the trend component, and the seasonal component can be obtained by subtracting the trend from the original time series.</li>
                <li>Seasonal decomposition of time series (STL): A more advanced technique that decomposes a time series into its seasonal, trend, and residual components using loess smoothing.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="trends">Trends</h3>
            <p>Trends represent the long-term direction of a time series. A trend can be upward, downward, or stationary. Identifying and accounting for trends can improve the accuracy of time series forecasts.</p>
            <h4>Detrending Methods</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Differencing: Subtracting the time series values at different lags, such as first-order differencing, where each observation is replaced by the difference between consecutive observations.</li>
                <li>Transformation: Applying a transformation to the time series, such as taking the logarithm, to stabilize the trend.</li>
                <li>Regression: Fitting a linear or nonlinear regression model to the time series and using the residuals as the detrended series.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="modeling-seasonality-and-trends">Modeling Seasonality and Trends</h3>
            <p>Some time series models explicitly account for seasonality and trends:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Seasonal ARIMA: An extension of the ARIMA model that includes seasonal differencing and seasonal autoregressive and moving average terms.</li>
                <li>Exponential smoothing state space model (ETS): A general class of forecasting models that can handle additive and multiplicative seasonality, as well as additive and multiplicative trends.</li>
                <li>Seasonal decomposition of time series (STL) forecasting: A two-step approach where the time series is first decomposed into its components, and then each component is forecasted separately.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="example-monthly-airline-passenger-data">Example: Monthly Airline Passenger Data</h3>
            <p>Consider a time series of monthly airline passenger data. This time series exhibits both an upward trend and a seasonal pattern that repeats every 12 months. To model and forecast this time series, we can:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Decompose the time series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components.</li>
                <li>Detrend the time series using differencing or transformation.</li>
                <li>Fit an appropriate model, such as seasonal ARIMA or ETS, that accounts for both trend and seasonality.</li>
                <li>Forecast future values using the fitted model.</li>
            </ol>
