        <h2>Solving Programming Brain Teasers: A Guide</h2>
        <p><i>This article is written in: ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</i></p>
        <p>Programming brain teasers can be a fun and rewarding way to test your coding skills and problem-solving abilities. These types of problems are often used in technical interviews to evaluate a candidate's ability to think critically and come up with efficient solutions. If you're looking to improve your chances of success in these types of situations, it's important to have a strong understanding of how to approach and solve these types of problems.</p>
        <p>In this article, we'll provide some general tips and strategies for solving programming brain teasers, as well as specific suggestions for working with different data structures such as arrays, strings, graphs, and trees. By following these guidelines, you'll be well-equipped to tackle even the most challenging brain teasers.</p>
        <h2>General Tips</h2>
        <p>Here are some general rules of thumb to keep in mind when solving programming brain teasers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a problem is unfamiliar, start with a brute force solution. This can help you get a sense of the problem and start thinking about potential solutions. You can then optimize your solution later on.</li>
            <li>Write unit tests. These can be extremely helpful in verifying that your solution is correct and identifying any bugs or issues.</li>
            <li>Pay attention to the time complexity of your solution. In competitive programming, time is often the most critical factor, so try to come up with solutions that have a time complexity of O(n) or better.</li>
            <li>Always consider using hash tables (also known as dictionaries) for fast access to data. These data structures allow you to access elements in O(1) time complexity, making them very efficient for certain types of problems.</li>
            <li>To increase speed, consider what information you can store to save time. For example, you might use an auxiliary data structure to improve the time complexity of your solution.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Data structures</h2>
        <h3>Working with Arrays</h3>
        <p>Arrays are a common data structure used in programming brain teasers. Here are some tips for working with arrays:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Try sorting the array first. This can often make it easier to find patterns and solve the problem. Consider using a sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n), such as merge sort or quick sort.</li>
            <li>If the array is already sorted, consider using a binary search algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(log n). This can be an efficient way to find specific elements in the array.</li>
            <li>Use the two pointer technique. This involves using two pointers to iterate through the array, and can be useful for finding pairs of elements that meet certain criteria (such as having a sum of a certain value).</li>
            <li>Be mindful of the space complexity of your solution as well. If the array is very large, you may need to come up with a solution that does not require additional space or only requires a small amount of additional space.</li>
            <li>Consider using pointers to iterate through the array instead of a traditional for loop. Pointers can often be faster and more memory-efficient.</li>
            <li>If you need to perform frequent insertions or deletions in the middle of an array, a linked list may be a better data structure to use than an array.</li>
            <li>When working with arrays, pay attention to the order of your operations. If you need to perform multiple operations on an array, try to do them in a way that minimizes the number of times you need to shift elements around in the array.</li>
            <li>If you need to find the maximum or minimum element in an array, consider using a divide and conquer approach, which can often find the maximum or minimum in O(n) time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Working with Strings</h3>
        <p>Strings are another common data structure used in programming brain teasers. Here are some tips for working with strings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you have a large number of strings, consider putting them in a prefix tree (also known as a trie). This can be an efficient way to store and search for strings.</li>
            <li>Strings are immutable in Python, which means you can't change a string in place. If you need to modify a string, you will have to create a new string with the desired modifications.</li>
            <li>The str.format() method is a powerful way to build strings with dynamic content. It allows you to insert placeholders in a string and fill them with values from variables or expressions.</li>
            <li>The str.join() method can be used to concatenate a list of strings into a single string, using a specified separator. This is often more efficient than using a loop to manually concatenate the strings.</li>
            <li>The str.split() method can be used to split a string into a list of substrings, using a specified delimiter.</li>
            <li>Python's re module provides functions for working with regular expressions, which can be used to match patterns in strings and extract or modify substrings.</li>
            <li>Unicode is a standardized character encoding that represents most of the world's written languages. Python supports Unicode natively, and you can use special escape sequences (like \uxxxx) to include Unicode characters in string literals.</li>
            <li>The unicodedata module provides functions for working with Unicode data, such as finding the category of a character or decomposing a character into its component parts.</li>
            <li>Python's bytes type represents a sequence of bytes, which can be used to store binary data or encode strings in a particular character encoding. You can use the str.encode() and bytes.decode() methods to convert between strings and bytes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Linked lists</h3>
        <p>Here are some points to keep in mind while working with linked lists:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a chain of nodes, each containing a value and a reference to the next node in the list. The last node in the list has a reference to None instead of a next node.</li>
            <li>Linked lists can be singly-linked, where each node has a reference to the next node, or doubly-linked, where each node has references to both the next and previous nodes.</li>
            <li>Linked lists are dynamic data structures, meaning that they can grow and shrink in size as needed. This makes them useful for situations where the size of the data is not known in advance.</li>
            <li>Linked lists have constant-time insertions and deletions, as it is not necessary to move other elements when adding or removing an element from the list. However, they have linear-time search and access, as it is necessary to traverse the list to find a specific element.* </li>
            <li>It is important to keep track of the head and tail of the list, as well as the size of the list. These can be stored as separate variables or as properties of the list class.</li>
            <li>Common operations on linked lists include inserting and deleting elements, searching for elements, and traversing the list.</li>
            <li>When implementing a linked list, it is important to consider edge cases such as inserting or deleting the first or last element, or handling an empty list.</li>
            <li>Use a dummy head for linked list problems that require inserting nodes at the front of the list. This will simplify the code and avoid edge cases where the head of the list needs to be updated.</li>
            <li>Use a slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle node of a linked list or to detect a cycle in a linked list. This involves creating two pointers, one that moves at a slower pace and one that moves at a faster pace. If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list before the slow pointer, it means that the list is not cyclic. If the fast pointer catches up to the slow pointer, it means that there is a cycle in the list.</li>
            <li>Use the technique of reversing a linked list to solve problems that require traversing a linked list in the reverse order. This can be done by iteratively updating the next pointers of each node to point to the previous node.</li>
            <li>Use a stack to simulate the recursive calls of a recursive solution for a linked list problem. This can be useful when the recursive solution exceeds the maximum depth of the call stack.</li>
            <li>When working with linked lists, it is often necessary to keep track of the previous node in addition to the current node. This can be done by using a "dummy" node that points to the head of the list and updating the next pointer of the dummy node as the linked list is traversed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Working with Binary Trees</h3>
        <p>Binary trees are a common data structure used in programming brain teasers. Here are some tips for working with binary trees:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When working with binary trees, you may need to perform operations such as search, insert, and predecessor.</li>
            <li>There are three main traversal orders for binary trees: in-order, pre-order, and post-order. In-order traversal is done by visiting the left node, the root, and then the right node. Pre-order traversal is done by visiting the root, the left node, and then the right node. Post-order traversal is done by visiting the left node, the right node, and then the root.</li>
            <li>You can construct a complete tree with an array by using a recursive function to create a TreeNode with the value at each index, and setting its left and right properties to the result of calling the function on the indices i * 2 + 1 and i * 2 + 2. The base case is when i becomes larger than the length of the array.</li>
            <li>When working with binary trees, you'll typically want to use a binary search tree (BST) or a self-balancing BST such as an AVL tree. These types of trees are more efficient for inserting, searching, and deleting elements, and have a time complexity of O(logn).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Working with n-ary Trees</h3>
        <p>n-ary trees are trees that have no more than n children. Some common types of n-ary trees include trie trees and AVL trees. Here are some tips for working with these types of trees:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Trie trees, also known as retrieval trees, are commonly used to store words or strings. They allow for fast lookup of specific words, but can use a lot of memory due to the fact that each node can point to up to 26 other nodes (one for each letter in the alphabet). The time complexity for both retrieval and insertion in a trie tree is O(n), where n is the length of the key being searched for or inserted.</li>
            <li>AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees that maintain a balance factor of no more than 1 (the difference in height between the left and right subtrees). This ensures that the tree has O(logn) time complexity for operations such as insertion, retrieval, and deletion. However, if the balance factor becomes greater than 1 during an insertion or deletion, a rebalance operation is needed, which has a time complexity of O(logn).</li>
            <li>Red-black trees are another type of self-balancing tree that may be more efficient for scenarios with a large number of insertions and deletions. They have a slightly lower level of balance than AVL trees, but are generally faster due to the fact that they require fewer rotations.</li>
            <li>When deciding between using a balanced BST or a hash map, consider whether you need to store ordered or unordered items. Hash maps are efficient for storing unordered items and have constant time lookup, while balanced BSTs are efficient for storing ordered items and allow for operations such as finding the value nearest to a certain value. The time complexity for lookup in a balanced BST is O(logn).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Working with Graphs</h3>
        <p>Graphs are a common data structure used in programming brain teasers. Here are some tips for working with graphs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When storing a graph, there are a few different options to consider. These include an edge list (a list of edges between numbered nodes, with a weight if needed), an adjacency matrix (a V * V array with 0s and 1s indicating the presence of an edge), and an adjacency list (an array or hash table with a list of edges at each element, where the key is the node and the edges are the values).</li>
            <li>Consider treating the problem as a graph problem and using breadth-first or depth-first traversal to solve it.</li>
            <li>Use a stack if the problem involves parsing or traversals.</li>
            <li>Consider using heaps whenever you need to take the minimum or maximum of a dynamic collection.</li>
            <li>For directed graphs, it can be useful to store the graph using nodes as objects and edges as pointers (OOP). This can work well because you don't have to maintain the storage of an edge at each vertex and don't have to worry about becoming unsynchronized.</li>
            <li>When working with directed graphs, you'll need to keep track of visited nodes to avoid getting stuck in infinite loops. One option is to use a set to keep track of visited nodes, as this allows for constant lookup time and easy initialization. Alternatively, you can use a visited array in your recursive stack to keep track of the current path and detect cycles.</li>
            <li>When working with undirected graphs, you'll need to be careful to skip the parent node when calling the DFS on each neighbor to avoid detecting non-existent cycles.</li>
            <li>To determine whether a graph is a tree, consider the following two conditions: (1) the graph is fully connected (i.e., for every pair of nodes in the graph, there is a path between them) and (2) the graph contains no cycles (i.e., there is exactly one path between each pair of nodes in the graph).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Hash tables</h3>
        <p>Here are some points to keep in mind while working with hash tables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. It allows for constant-time insertions, deletions, and searches, making it an efficient data structure for storing and retrieving data.</li>
            <li>Hash tables use an array to store the data, and the hash function maps the keys to indices in the array. A collision occurs when two keys map to the same index, and must be resolved by storing the data in a different way at that index.</li>
            <li>There are various techniques for resolving collisions, including chaining (using a linked list at each index to store the data), open addressing (probing through the array to find an empty slot), and linear probing (finding the next available slot in the array).</li>
            <li>The choice of hash function is important for the efficiency of the hash table. A good hash function should distribute the keys evenly across the indices of the array and minimize the number of collisions.</li>
            <li>The load factor, or the ratio of the number of elements to the size of the array, can affect the performance of the hash table. A high load factor can increase the number of collisions and decrease the performance of the hash table.</li>
            <li>Hash tables have constant-time insertions, deletions, and searches on average, but the worst-case time complexity for these operations can be linear.</li>
            <li>In Python, the built-in dict data type is implemented using a hash table. The hash() function can be used to compute the hash value of an object, and the set() data type is implemented using a hash table.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Algorithms</h2>
        <p>Algorithms are a set of steps or procedures used to solve a problem. There are various types of algorithms that can be used to solve different types of problems, and choosing the right algorithm is crucial for finding an efficient solution. Some common types of algorithms include:</p>
        <h2>Two pointers</h2>
        <p>The two pointer technique is a method used to traverse through a list or array with two pointers pointing to different elements. One pointer is usually at the start of the list and the other at the end. The pointers then move towards each other, depending on a certain condition. This technique is often used to solve problems involving subarrays or finding the maximum or minimum of a subarray.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Begin by identifying the problem constraints and deciding which of the two pointer approaches (i.e. starting from the beginning, ending, or middle of the list) is most appropriate</li>
            <li>Carefully consider the conditions under which you will increment or decrement the pointers, and ensure that these are consistent with the problem constraints</li>
            <li>Pay attention to the bounds of your pointers to avoid going out of range of the list</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recursion</h3>
        <p>Recursion is a method of solving problems where the solution is based on solving smaller instances of the same problem. In other words, the solution to a problem is expressed in terms of itself. Recursion is a powerful technique that can be used to solve problems that are difficult to solve using other methods.</p>
        <p>To use recursion, you need to identify the base case, which is the smallest instance of the problem that can be solved directly. The base case is used to stop the recursion and provide a solution for the problem. The solution for the base case is then used to solve larger instances of the problem, by calling the function recursively.</p>
        <h2>Backtracking</h2>
        <p>Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start by identifying the base case(s) of your problem, as these will be the stopping point for your recursive calls</li>
            <li>Carefully consider the recursive case, and identify what steps need to be taken in order to break the problem down into smaller subproblems</li>
            <li>Use a suitable data structure, such as a stack or queue, to store your potential solutions as you explore the different possibilities</li>
            <li>Consider using pruning techniques to avoid exploring unnecessary paths and improve the efficiency of your solution</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Dynamic Programming and Memoization</h2>
        <p>Dynamic programming is a method of solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems in order to avoid redundant calculations. There are two approaches to dynamic programming: top-down and bottom-up.</p>
        <p>In the top-down approach, you start with the problem itself and break it down into smaller pieces in order to solve it. This approach is also known as memoization, as you use a cache to store already computed results in order to prevent redundant calculations. The top-down approach is often easier to code and more intuitive, but it may not be as efficient as the bottom-up approach in some cases.</p>
        <p>In the bottom-up approach, you start with the smallest subproblems and build up to the final solution. This approach is often used when each subproblem must be solved at least once, as it ensures that all subproblems are solved in the correct order. The bottom-up approach may also be more efficient than the top-down approach in terms of memory usage because it avoids the need for recursive function calls, which can take up space on the call stack. In the bottom-up approach, the subproblems are solved and stored in a table or array, so there is no need to keep track of the intermediate state of the function during the recursive calls. This can be especially important in cases where the subproblems are large or there are many of them, as the call stack can quickly become overloaded. Additionally, the bottom-up approach allows for better control over the order in which the subproblems are solved, as it is possible to solve the subproblems in a specific order that ensures that the required information is available when it is needed. This can be particularly useful in cases where the subproblems have dependencies on one another.</p>
        <h3>Greedy algorithms</h3>
        <p>A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In other words, a greedy algorithm makes the most optimal choice at each step, without considering the consequences of those choices on future steps.</p>
        <p>One of the main advantages of greedy algorithms is that they are easy to understand and implement. However, they are not always the most efficient solution to a problem, as they may not always find the global optimum.</p>
        <h3>Sorting</h3>
        <p>There are many different sorting algorithms that can be used to order a list of items. It is important to know the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and choose the one that is most appropriate for the task at hand.</p>
        <h4>Insertion Sort</h4>
        <p>Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iterating through the list and inserting each item in its correct place in the sorted portion of the list. It is best suited for lists that are already mostly sorted, as it has a time complexity of O(n) in this case. Insertion sort is stable, meaning that it preserves the original order of items with equal keys.</p>
        <h4>Merge Sort</h4>
        <p>Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that works by recursively splitting the list into halves and then merging the sorted halves back together. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) and is stable.</p>
        <h4>Quick Sort</h4>
        <p>Quick sort is another divide and conquer algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element and then partitioning the list around it. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) on average, but can be as bad as O(n^2) in the worst case. Quick sort is not stable.</p>
        <h4>Other Sorting Algorithms</h4>
        <p>Other commonly used sorting algorithms include heap sort, radix sort, and timsort (a hybrid of merge sort and insertion sort). In Python, the built-in list.sort() function uses timsort. There are also many other sorting algorithms that are less commonly used, such as bubble sort and selection sort.</p>
        <h4>Choosing a Sorting Algorithm</h4>
        <p>When choosing a sorting algorithm, it is important to consider the time complexity and stability of the algorithm, as well as any additional constraints or requirements of the task. In general, divide and conquer algorithms such as merge sort and quick sort have a good time complexity and are suitable for many tasks. However, insertion sort may be a better choice for lists that are already mostly sorted, and heap sort may be a good choice for sorting large lists that do not fit in memory.</p>
        <h3>Bit Manipulation</h3>
        <p>Bit manipulation is the act of altering or manipulating individual bits in a value stored in a computer's memory. This is often used in computer programming to perform low-level operations or to optimize code by minimizing the number of instructions used to perform a certain operation. Some common bit manipulation techniques include bit shifting, masking, and setting or clearing individual bits.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be familiar with the binary representation of integers and how to perform basic operations such as shifting, ORing, ANDing, and XORing on them</li>
            <li>Understand the difference between signed and unsigned integers and how to perform arithmetic shifts for signed integers</li>
            <li>Know how to convert between binary and decimal representations, and be able to perform basic arithmetic operations in binary</li>
            <li>Keep in mind the bitwise operators have a lower precedence than most other operators, so you may need to use parentheses to specify the order of operations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>List of problems</h2>
        <h3>Minimum deletions to make valid parentheses</h3>
        <p>Given a string of parentheses, determine the minimum number of parentheses that need to be removed to make the string valid. This can be solved using a stack data structure to track the open parentheses as we iterate through the string. If we encounter an open parenthesis, we add it to the stack. If we encounter a closing parenthesis, we check if there is a matching open parenthesis on the top of the stack. If there is, we pop the open parenthesis from the stack. If there is not, we add the closing parenthesis to a list of characters to remove. After we have processed the entire string, we remove the remaining open parentheses from the stack.</p>

        </ul>
        <h3>Is palindrome after at most one char delete?</h3>
        <p>Determinine whether a string can be transformed into a palindrome by deleting at most one character. This can be solved using a two pointer approach, where we start from both ends of the string and move towards the middle. If we encounter a pair of characters that are not equal, we have three options: delete the character at the left pointer, delete the character at the right pointer, or delete both characters. We check if any of these options results in a palindrome and return the result.</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <h3>K closest points to origin</h3>
        <p>Find the K points in a list of points that are closest to the origin (0, 0). This can be solved using a min heap data structure, where we store the K closest points so far. As we iterate through the list of points, we compute the distance from each point to the origin and add it to the heap if it is among the K closest points so far.</p>

        <h3>Subarray sum equals K</h3>
        <p>Find a contiguous subarray of an array that has a sum of K. This can be solved using a sliding window approach, where we maintain a running sum of the elements in the window and move the window through the array until we find a subarray with the desired sum.</p>

        <h3>Dot product of two sparse vectors</h3>
        <p>Compute the dot product of two sparse vectors, where a vector is represented as a list of (index, value) pairs. This can be solved by iterating through both vectors and adding up the products of the values at the same index.</p>

        <h3>Range sum of BST</h3>
        <p>Compute the sum of the values of all the nodes in a binary search tree within a given range. This can be solved using a recursive in-order traversal of the tree, where we add the value of each node to the sum if it is within the range.</p>

        <h3>Product of array except self</h3>
        <p>Compute an array where each element is the product of all the other elements in the input array. This can be solved using two pass approach, where we first compute the product of all the elements before each index and then compute the product of all the elements after each index.</p>

        <h3>Convert BST to sorted doubly linked list</h3>
        <p>Convert a binary search tree to a sorted doubly linked list. This can be solved using a recursive in-order traversal of the tree, where we build the linked list by adding each node to the end of the list as we visit it.</p>

        </ul>
        <h3>Lowest common ancestor of a binary tree</h3>
        <p>Find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree. The LCA is the node in the tree that is the ancestor of both nodes and is the deepest node in the tree. To solve this problem, you can use a variety of techniques such as traversing the tree in a depth-first or breadth-first manner, or using a recursive approach to traverse the tree and find the LCA. You can also use a divide and conquer approach, where you split the tree into left and right subtrees and find the LCA in each subtree. Another approach is to use a hash table or a map to store the ancestors of each node and then use this information to find the LCA.</p>

        </ul>
        <h3>LRU Cache</h3>
        <p>Designing a cache data structure that stores a limited number of items and removes the least recently used items when the capacity is reached. This can be solved using a doubly linked list and a hash table. The doubly linked list is used to store the items in the cache in the order in which they were accessed, with the most recently accessed item at the front of the list and the least recently accessed item at the back. The hash table is used to store the keys and values of the items in the cache and to quickly retrieve items from the cache based on their keys.</p>

        </ul>
        <h3>Randomize An Array</h3>
        <p>Shuffle the elements of an array randomly. This can be solved using a random number generator and a Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm. The Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm works by starting at the end of the array and randomly swapping each element with an element preceding it. This results in a randomly shuffled array.</p>
        <ul>

        <h3>Binary Tree Right Side View</h3>
        <p>Given a binary tree, return an array containing the values of the nodes on the right side of the tree, when viewed from the right. One way to solve this problem might be to perform a breadth-first search on the tree, keeping track of the maximum depth of each node as it is visited. When visiting a node at a particular depth for the first time, add its value to the result array.</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <h3>Design Browser History</h3>
        <p>Implement a browser history system that supports the following operations: visit a URL, go back to the previous URL, and go forward to the next URL. One potential approach to this problem could involve using a doubly-linked list to store the URLs visited, with a pointer to the current URL. Going back or forward would simply involve moving the pointer to the previous or next URL in the list.</p>
        <ul>

        <h3>Score After Flipping Matrix</h3>
        <p>Given a matrix of 0s and 1s, flip the rows and columns of the matrix such that the maximum possible score is achieved. The score is calculated as the number of 1s in the matrix. One way to solve this problem might be to use dynamic programming to compute the maximum score for each submatrix of the original matrix, taking into account whether the rows and columns of the submatrix should be flipped.</p>
