            <h2 id="dynamic-programming">Dynamic Programming</h2>
            <p>Dynamic Programming (DP) is a way to solve complex problems by breaking them into smaller, easier problems. Instead of solving the same small problems again and again, DP <strong>stores their solutions</strong> in a structure like an array, table, or map. This avoids wasting time on repeated calculations and makes the process much faster and more efficient.</p>
            <p>DP works best for problems that have two features. The first is <strong>optimal substructure</strong>, which means you can build the solution to a big problem from the solutions to smaller problems. The second is <strong>overlapping subproblems</strong>, where the same smaller problems show up multiple times during the process. By focusing on these features, DP ensures that each part of the problem is solved only once.</p>
            <p>This method was introduced by Richard Bellman in the 1950s and has become a valuable tool in areas like computer science, economics, and operations research. It has been used to solve problems that would otherwise take too long by turning slow, exponential-time algorithms into much faster polynomial-time solutions. DP is used in practice for tackling real-world optimization challenges.</p>
            <h3 id="principles">Principles</h3>
            <p>To effectively apply dynamic programming, a problem must satisfy two properties:</p>
            <h4 id="1-optimal-substructure">1. Optimal Substructure</h4>
            <p>A problem has <strong>optimal substructure</strong> when the best solution to the overall problem can be built from the best solutions to its smaller parts. In simple terms, solving the smaller pieces perfectly ensures the entire problem is solved perfectly too. </p>
            <p>Formally, if the optimal solution $S_n$ for a problem of size $n$ can be created by combining the optimal solutions $S_k$ for smaller sizes $k &lt; n$, then the problem is said to exhibit optimal substructure.</p>
            <p><strong>Mathematical Representation</strong>:</p>
            <p>Consider a problem where we want to find the optimal value $V(n)$ for a given parameter $n$. If there exists a function $f$ such that:</p>
            <p>$$ V(n) = \min_{k} { f(V(k), V(n - k)) } $$</p>
            <p>then the problem exhibits optimal substructure.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: Shortest Path in Graphs</p>
            <p>In the context of graph algorithms, suppose we want to find the shortest path from vertex $A$ to vertex $C$. If $B$ is an intermediate vertex on the shortest path from $A$ to $C$, then the shortest path from $A$ to $C$ is the concatenation of the shortest path from $A$ to $B$ and the shortest path from $B$ to $C$.</p>
            <h4 id="2-overlapping-subproblems">2. Overlapping Subproblems</h4>
            <p>A problem has <strong>overlapping subproblems</strong> when it can be divided into smaller problems that are solved multiple times. This happens when the same subproblem appears in different parts of the solution process. In a straightforward recursive approach, this leads to solving the same subproblem repeatedly, which wastes time and resources. Dynamic Programming addresses this by solving each subproblem once and storing the result for reuse, improving efficiency significantly.</p>
            <p><strong>Mathematical Representation</strong>:</p>
            <p>Let $S(n)$ be the set of subproblems for problem size $n$. If there exists $s \in S(n)$ such that $s$ appears in $S(k)$ for multiple $k$, the problem has overlapping subproblems.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: Fibonacci Numbers</p>
            <p>The recursive computation of Fibonacci numbers $F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)$ involves recalculating the same Fibonacci numbers multiple times. For instance, to compute $F(5)$, we need to compute $F(4)$ and $F(3)$, both of which require computing $F(2)$ and $F(1)$ multiple times.</p>
            <h3 id="techniques">Techniques</h3>
            <p>There are two primary methods for implementing dynamic programming algorithms:</p>
            <h4 id="1-memoization-top-down-approach-">1. Memoization (Top-Down Approach)</h4>
            <p><strong>Memoization</strong> is a technique used to optimize recursive problem-solving by storing the results of solved subproblems in a data structure, such as a hash table or an array. When the algorithm encounters a subproblem, it first checks if the result is already stored. If it is, the algorithm simply retrieves the cached result instead of recomputing it. This approach reduces redundant calculations, making the solution process faster and more efficient.</p>
            <p><strong>Algorithm Steps</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify the parameters that uniquely define a subproblem and create a <strong>recursive function</strong> using these parameters.</li>
                <li>Establish <strong>base cases</strong> to terminate recursion.</li>
                <li>Initialize a data structure to <strong>store</strong> computed subproblem results.</li>
                <li>Before computing a subproblem, <strong>check if its result is already stored</strong>.</li>
                <li>If not already computed, <strong>compute the subproblem's result</strong> and store it.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: Computing Fibonacci Numbers with Memoization</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-python">def fibonacci(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n &lt;= 1:
        memo[n] = n
    else:
        memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci(n - 2, memo)
    return memo[n]</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Analysis</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time Complexity</strong>: $O(n)$, since each number up to $n$ is computed once.</li>
                <li><strong>Space Complexity</strong>: $O(n)$, due to the memoization structure.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="2-tabulation-bottom-up-approach-">2. Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach)</h4>
            <p><strong>Tabulation</strong> is a technique that solves a problem by working from the smallest subproblems up to the larger ones in a step-by-step, iterative way. It stores the solutions to these subproblems in a table, often an array, and uses these stored values to solve bigger subproblems until the final solution is reached. Unlike memoization, which works recursively and checks if a solution is already computed, tabulation systematically builds the solution from the ground up. This method is efficient and avoids the overhead of recursive calls.</p>
            <p><strong>Algorithm Steps</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Initialize the table</strong> by setting up a structure to store the results of subproblems, and ensure that base cases are properly initialized to handle the simplest instances of the problem.</li>
                <li><strong>Iterative computation</strong> is carried out using loops to fill the table, making sure that each subproblem is solved in the correct order before being used to solve larger subproblems.</li>
                <li><strong>Construct the solution</strong> by referencing the filled table, using the stored values to derive the final solution to the original problem efficiently.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: Computing Fibonacci Numbers with Tabulation</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-python">def fibonacci(n):
    if n &lt;= 1:
        return n
    fib_table = [0] * (n + 1)
    fib_table[0], fib_table[1] = 0, 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fib_table[i] = fib_table[i - 1] + fib_table[i - 2]
    return fib_table[n]</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Analysis</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>time complexity</strong> is ( O(n) ), since the algorithm iterates from 2 to ( n ), computing each Fibonacci number sequentially.</li>
                <li>The <strong>space complexity</strong> is ( O(n) ), due to the storage required for the table that holds the Fibonacci numbers up to ( n ).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="implementation-techniques">Implementation Techniques</h3>
            <p>Dynamic programming problems are often formulated using recurrence relations, which express the solution to a problem in terms of its subproblems.</p>
            <h4 id="formulating-recurrence-relations">Formulating Recurrence Relations</h4>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)</p>
            <p>Given two sequences $X = x_1, x_2, ..., x_m$ and $Y = y_1, y_2, ..., y_n$, the length of their LCS can be defined recursively:</p>
            <p>$$ LCS(i, j) = \begin{cases}
                0 &amp; \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
                LCS(i - 1, j - 1) + 1 &amp; \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
                \max(LCS(i - 1, j), LCS(i, j - 1)) &amp; \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
                \end{cases} $$</p>
            <p><strong>Implementation</strong>:</p>
            <p>We can implement the LCS problem using either memoization or tabulation. With tabulation, we build a two-dimensional table $LCS[0..m][0..n]$ iteratively.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>time complexity</strong> is ( O(mn) ), as the algorithm processes a grid or matrix of size ( m \times n ), iterating through each cell.</li>
                <li>The <strong>space complexity</strong> is ( O(mn) ), due to the table storing intermediate results, but this can be reduced to ( O(n) ) by optimizing the storage to only keep necessary data for the current and previous rows.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="state-representation">State Representation</h4>
            <p>Properly defining the state is crucial for dynamic programming.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>State variables</strong> are the parameters that uniquely define each subproblem, helping to break down the problem into smaller, manageable components.</li>
                <li><strong>State transition</strong> refers to the rules or formulas that describe how to move from one state to another, typically using the results of smaller subproblems to solve larger ones.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: 0/1 Knapsack Problem</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>problem statement</strong> focuses on selecting ( n ) items, each with a weight ( w_i ) and value ( v_i ), while ensuring the total weight stays within the knapsack capacity ( W ), in order to maximize the total value.</li>
                <li>In <strong>state representation</strong>, ( dp[i][w] ) represents the maximum value that can be achieved using the first ( i ) items with a total weight capacity of ( w ).</li>
                <li><strong>State Transition</strong>:</li>
            </ul>
            <p>$$ dp[i][w] = \begin{cases}
                dp[i - 1][w] &amp; \text{if } w_i &gt; w \\
                \max(dp[i - 1][w], dp[i - 1][w - w_i] + v_i) &amp; \text{if } w_i \leq w
                \end{cases} $$</p>
            <p><strong>Implementation</strong>:</p>
            <p>We fill the table $dp[0..n][0..W]$ iteratively based on the state transition.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>time complexity</strong> is $O(nW)$, where $n$ is the number of items and $W$ is the capacity of the knapsack, as the algorithm iterates through both items and weights.</li>
                <li>The <strong>space complexity</strong> is $O(nW)$, but this can be optimized to $O(W)$ because each row in the table depends only on the values from the previous row, allowing for space reduction.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="advanced-concepts">Advanced Concepts</h3>
            <h4 id="memory-optimization">Memory Optimization</h4>
            <p>In some cases, we can optimize space complexity by noticing dependencies between states.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: Since $dp[i][w]$ depends only on $dp[i - 1][w]$ and $dp[i - 1][w - w_i]$, we can use a one-dimensional array and update it in reverse.</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-python">dp = [0] * (W + 1)
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for w in range(W, w_i - 1, -1):
        dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w - w_i] + v_i)</code></pre>
            </div>
            <h4 id="dealing-with-non-overlapping-subproblems">Dealing with Non-Overlapping Subproblems</h4>
            <p>If a problem has <strong>optimal substructure</strong> but does not have <strong>overlapping subproblems</strong>, it is often better to use <strong>Divide and Conquer</strong> instead of Dynamic Programming. Divide and Conquer works by breaking the problem into independent subproblems, solving each one separately, and then combining their solutions. Since there are no repeated subproblems to reuse, storing intermediate results (as in Dynamic Programming) is unnecessary, making Divide and Conquer a more suitable and efficient choice in such cases.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: Merge Sort algorithm divides the list into halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.</p>
            <h3 id="common-terms">Common Terms</h3>
            <h4 id="recursion">Recursion</h4>
            <p>A process is called <strong>recursion</strong> when a function solves a problem by calling itself, either directly or indirectly, with a smaller instance of the same problem. This continues until the function reaches a <strong>base case</strong>, which is a condition that stops further recursive calls and provides a straightforward solution. Recursion is useful for problems that can naturally be divided into similar smaller subproblems.</p>
            <p><strong>Mathematical Perspective</strong>:</p>
            <p>A recursive function $f(n)$ satisfies:</p>
            <p>$$ f(n) = g(f(k), f(n - k)) $$</p>
            <p>for some function $g$ and smaller subproblem size $k &lt; n$.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: Computing $n!$:</p>
            <p>$$ n! = n \times (n - 1)! $$</p>
            <p>with base case $0! = 1$.</p>
            <h4 id="subset">Subset</h4>
            <p>For a set $S$, a subset $T$ is a set where every element of $T$ is also an element of $S$. Denoted as $T \subseteq S$.</p>
            <p><strong>Mathematical Properties</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>total subsets</strong> of a set with $n$ elements is $2^n$, as each element can either be included or excluded from a subset.</li>
                <li>The <strong>power set</strong> of a set $S$, denoted as $\mathcal{P}(S)$, is the set of all possible subsets of $S$, including the empty set and $S$ itself.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Relevance to DP</strong>:</p>
            <p>Subsets often represent different states or configurations in combinatorial problems, such as the subset-sum problem.</p>
            <h4 id="subarray">Subarray</h4>
            <p>A contiguous segment of an array $A$. A subarray is defined by a starting index $i$ and an ending index $j$, with $0 \leq i \leq j &lt; n$, where $n$ is the length of the array.</p>
            <p><strong>Mathematical Representation</strong>:</p>
            <p>$$ \text{Subarray } A[i..j] = [A_i, A_{i+1}, ..., A_j] $$</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
            <p>Given $A = [3, 5, 7, 9]$, the subarray from index $1$ to $2$ is $[5, 7]$.</p>
            <p><strong>Relevance to DP</strong>:</p>
            <p>Subarray problems include finding the maximum subarray sum (Kadane's algorithm), where dynamic programming efficiently computes optimal subarrays.</p>
            <h4 id="substring">Substring</h4>
            <p>A contiguous sequence of characters within a string $S$. Analogous to subarrays in arrays.</p>
            <p><strong>Mathematical Representation</strong>:</p>
            <p>A substring $S[i..j]$ is:</p>
            <p>$$ S_iS_{i+1}...S_j $$</p>
            <p>with $0 \leq i \leq j &lt; \text{length}(S)$.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
            <p>For $S = "dynamic"$, the substring from index $2$ to $4$ is $"nam"$.</p>
            <p><strong>Relevance to DP</strong>:</p>
            <p>Substring problems include finding the longest palindromic substring or the longest common substring between two strings.</p>
            <h4 id="subsequence">Subsequence</h4>
            <p>A sequence derived from another sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.</p>
            <p><strong>Mathematical Representation</strong>:</p>
            <p>Given sequence $S$, subsequence $T$ is:</p>
            <p>$$ T = [S_{i_1}, S_{i_2}, ..., S_{i_k}] $$</p>
            <p>where $0 \leq i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; ... &lt; i_k &lt; n$.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
            <p>For $S = [a, b, c, d]$, $[a, c, d]$ is a subsequence.</p>
            <p><strong>Relevance to DP</strong>:</p>
            <p>The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is a classic dynamic programming problem.</p>
            <p><strong>LCS Dynamic Programming Formulation</strong>:</p>
            <p>Let $X = x_1 x_2 ... x_m$ and $Y = y_1 y_2 ... y_n$. Define $L[i][j]$ as the length of the LCS of $X[1..i]$ and $Y[1..j]$.</p>
            <p><strong>Recurrence Relation</strong>:</p>
            <p>$$ L[i][j] = \begin{cases}
                0 &amp; \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
                L[i - 1][j - 1] + 1 &amp; \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
                \max(L[i - 1][j], L[i][j - 1]) &amp; \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
                \end{cases} $$</p>
            <p><strong>Implementation</strong>:</p>
            <p>We build a two-dimensional table $L[0..m][0..n]$ using the above recurrence.</p>
            <p><strong>Time Complexity</strong>: $O(mn)$</p>
            <h3 id="practical-considerations">Practical Considerations</h3>
            <h4 id="identifying-dp-problems">Identifying DP Problems</h4>
            <p>I. If the problem asks for the number of <em>ways</em> to do something:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Counting paths in a grid.</li>
                <li><em>Consequence:</em> Without DP, you would need to enumerate every route.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>II. If the task is to find the <em>minimum</em> or <em>maximum</em> value under constraints:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Knapsack problem.</li>
                <li><em>Consequence:</em> Without DP, you would need to check every subset of items.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>III. If the same <em>inputs</em> appear again during recursion:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Fibonacci numbers.</li>
                <li><em>Consequence:</em> Without DP, Fibonacci numbers would be recomputed many times.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>IV. If the solution depends on both the <em>current step</em> and <em>remaining resources</em> (time, weight, money, length):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Scheduling tasks within a time limit.</li>
                <li><em>Consequence:</em> Without DP, brute force would be required.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>V. If the problem works with <em>prefixes, substrings, or subsequences</em>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Longest common subsequence.</li>
                <li><em>Consequence:</em> Without DP, exponential checking would be needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>VI. If choices at each step must be explored and combined carefully:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Coin change with mixed denominations.</li>
                <li><em>Consequence:</em> Without DP, you cannot guarantee the fewest coins.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>VII. If the state space can be stored in a <em>table or array</em>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Problems with discrete states.</li>
                <li><em>Consequence:</em> Without this, problems with infinitely many possibilities (like arbitrary real numbers) cannot be handled.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="state-design-and-transition">State Design and Transition</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A well-chosen <em>state</em> defines what each subproblem represents, while a poorly chosen one leaves the formulation incomplete; for example, <code>dp[i][w]</code> in the knapsack problem captures value using <code>i</code> items and capacity <code>w</code>.</li>
                <li>A correct <em>transition</em> connects states consistently, while skipping this leads to undefined progress; in knapsack, the choice to include or exclude an item gives the formula for moving between states.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="complexity-optimization">Complexity Optimization</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Reducing <em>memory usage</em> by discarding unnecessary states makes solutions efficient, while failing to do so can waste resources; for example, knapsack space can shrink from <code>O(nW)</code> to <code>O(W)</code> with a one-dimensional array.</li>
                <li>Using <em>pruning</em> to skip impossible paths speeds up computation, while omitting it allows redundant work; in recursive search with memoization, branches exceeding a current best value can be safely ignored.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="common-pitfalls">Common Pitfalls</h4>
            <p>I. Failure to Define Proper Base Cases</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example</em>: In grid path counting, omitting <code>dp[0][0] = 1</code> prevents any valid paths from being constructed.</li>
                <li><em>Consequence</em>: Without correct starting values, the DP table propagates errors and produces incorrect results.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>II. Updating States in the Wrong Dependency Order</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example</em>: In knapsack with a 1D array, iterating weights from low to high causes items to be reused multiple times.</li>
                <li><em>Consequence</em>: Using the wrong order inflates computed values and leads to invalid or impossible solutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>III. Ignoring Special or Edge Case Inputs</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example</em>: In knapsack, a zero-capacity input should return zero value rather than throwing an error.</li>
                <li><em>Consequence</em>: Overlooking edge inputs causes crashes or incorrect answers in boundary conditions.</li>
            </ul>
