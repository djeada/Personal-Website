            <h2 id="data-structures-collections-and-containers">Data Structures: Collections and Containers</h2>
            <p>In computer science, a <em>collection</em> (often interchangeably referred to as a <em>container</em>) is a sophisticated data structure designed to hold multiple entities, these could be simple elements like numbers or text strings, or more complex objects like user-defined structures. Collections help you store, organize, and manipulate different types of data in your programs.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>At <strong>The Abstract Level</strong>, we focus on the conceptual understanding of collections, defining what they are and their characteristics. This includes how they store and retrieve items, whether it's based on a specific order (as in arrays or lists) or using unique keys (as in dictionaries or maps).</li>
                <li><strong>The Machine Level</strong> refers to the practical implementation of collections, where we concentrate on efficiently realizing the abstract models. Factors like memory usage, operation speeds (insertion, deletion, search), and flexibility help determine the best data structures and algorithms for a specific task.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Every developer should really get to know collections well. It helps you pick the right type of collection for the job, making your code faster, more efficient, and easier to manage in the long run.</p>

            <h3 id="linked-lists">Linked Lists</h3>
            <p>A <em>Linked List</em> is a basic way to organize data where you have a chain of nodes. Each node contains two distinct parts: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>A value (or data), which could range from simple data types to more complex structures.</li>
                <li>A reference (commonly referred to as a link or a pointer) to the subsequent node in the sequence.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Importantly, the last node in the linked list points to a null value, effectively signifying the end of the list.</p>
            <p>Linked lists can be highly valuable when the data doesn't require contiguous storage in memory or when the exact size of the data is undetermined at the time of memory allocation. While they can serve as an alternative to arrays, it's essential to note that linked lists generally have slower access times and are more challenging to manipulate due to their non-contiguous storage and absence of direct access to individual elements.</p>

            </div>
            </p>
            <h4 id="typical-interface">Typical Interface</h4>
            <p>Here are some standard operations associated with linked lists:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>is_empty()</code>: This checks if the list is devoid of any elements.</li>
                <li><code>front()</code>: This retrieves the first element in the list.</li>
                <li><code>append(element)</code>: This adds a new element to the end of the list.</li>
                <li><code>remove(index)</code>: This removes an element at a specified index.</li>
                <li><code>replace(index, data)</code>: This substitutes the element at a specified index with a new value.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="time-complexity">Time Complexity</h4>
            <p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Operation</td>
                    <td>Average case</td>
                    <td>Worst case</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Access</td>
                    <td><code>O(n)</code></td>
                    <td><code>O(n)</code></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                    <td>Delete</td>
                    <td><code>O(1)</code></td>
                    <td><code>O(1)</code></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Search</td>

                </tr>
            </table>
            </p>
            <p>Note that while insertion and deletion are constant time operations, access and search operations require traversing the list, resulting in linear time complexity.</p>
            <h4 id="common-applications">Common Applications</h4>
            <p>Linked lists find utility in a wide variety of areas including, but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Storing items that undergo frequent addition or removal operations. This is due to the cost-effective manipulation (insertion/deletion) capabilities of linked lists.</li>
                <li>Implementing other high-level data structures such as stacks and queues.</li>
                <li>Storing buckets in hash tables or elements in associative arrays.</li>
                <li>Maintaining key-value pairs in symbol tables or dictionaries.</li>
                <li>Representing nodes in advanced structures like graphs or tree data structures.</li>
                <li>Managing allocation or deallocation of memory blocks in memory management systems.</li>
                <li>Storing sequences of operations to support undo or redo functionality in software applications.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="implementation-details">Implementation Details</h4>
            <p>Linked lists can be implemented in various ways, largely dependent on the programming language used. A conventional implementation strategy involves defining a custom class or structure to represent a node. This class encapsulates a value and a reference to the next node. Additionally, methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements are provided to manipulate the list.</p>
            <p>In some languages, linked lists are provided as part of the standard library, abstracting away the underlying implementation details and providing a rich set of functionality.</p>

            <h3 id="vectors">Vectors</h3>
            <p>In computer science, a <em>vector</em> can be thought of as a dynamic array with the ability to adjust its size as required. While similar to traditional arrays, vectors distinguish themselves with their superior flexibility and efficiency in numerous scenarios. They store elements in contiguous blocks of memory, ensuring swift access to elements through index-based referencing.</p>
            <p>Vectors are often favored over low-level arrays due to their augmented feature set and integrated safety mechanisms. These characteristics contribute to their easier usability and overall reliability.</p>

            </div>
            </p>
            <h4 id="typical-interface">Typical Interface</h4>
            <p>Some of the commonly used operations for vectors are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>sort(start, end)</code>: This function sorts the elements in the specified range within the vector.</li>
                <li><code>reverse(start, end)</code>: This operation reverses the order of elements between specified positions.</li>
                <li><code>size()</code>: This function retrieves the current number of elements in the vector.</li>
                <li><code>capacity()</code>: This retrieves the maximum number of elements the vector can hold before needing to resize.</li>
                <li><code>resize(new_size)</code>: This operation alters the vector size, adding or removing elements as necessary.</li>
                <li><code>reserve(new_capacity)</code>: This increases the vector capacity, if required, without changing the vector size.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="time-complexity">Time Complexity</h4>
            <p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Operation</td>
                    <td>Average case</td>
                    <td>Worst case</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Access</td>
                    <td><code>O(1)</code></td>
                    <td><code>O(1)</code></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Insert</td>
                    <td><code>O(1)</code></td>
                    <td><code>O(n)</code></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Delete</td>
                    <td><code>O(1)</code></td>
                    <td><code>O(n)</code></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Search</td>
                    <td><code>O(n)</code></td>
                    <td><code>O(n)</code></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            </p>
            <p>While access to elements is a constant time operation, insertions and deletions can vary depending on where these operations are performed. If at the end, they are constant time operations; however, elsewhere, these operations can result in shifting of elements, causing linear time complexity.</p>
            <h4 id="common-applications">Common Applications</h4>
            <p>Vectors can be leveraged for a wide array of tasks, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Storing collections of values. Vectors are adept at storing and manipulating ordered lists of homogenous data types.</li>
                <li>Executing matrix operations. Vectors provide a good structure for representing matrices and performing computations on them.</li>
                <li>Implementing various search and sorting algorithms. Due to their continuous memory allocation and indexing, vectors are ideal for executing such algorithms.</li>
                <li>Creating intricate data structures. Vectors can serve as foundational building blocks in the implementation of more complex data structures.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="implementation-details">Implementation Details</h4>
            <p>Vectors are typically implemented using an array of elements accompanied by additional metadata such as the current size and total capacity. When a resize operation is necessary, a new, larger array is created, and the existing elements are copied over to the new array. As resizing can be time and resource-consuming, vectors often allocate extra memory ahead of time to minimize the frequency of resizing.</p>
            <p>In some programming languages, vectors might internally use other data structures like linked lists. However, regardless of the underlying implementation, the interface presented to the programmer and the time complexity of the operations remain similar.</p>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            <h3 id="stacks">Stacks</h3>
            <p>A <em>stack</em> is a fundamental data structure that models a First-In-Last-Out (FILO) or Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) strategy. In essence, the most recently added element (the top of the stack) is the first one to be removed. This data structure is widely utilized across various programming languages to execute a range of operations, such as arithmetic computations, character printing, and more.</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-shell">[5]  &lt;- top

            </div>
            </p>
            <h4 id="typical-interface">Typical Interface</h4>
            <p>Typical operations associated with a stack include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>push(element)</code>: This method places a new element on top of the stack, effectively becoming the most recent addition.</li>
                <li><code>pop()</code>: This method returns the top element of the stack and simultaneously removes it.</li>
                <li><code>top()</code>: This method simply returns the top element without removing it from the stack, allowing you to inspect the most recent addition.</li>
                <li><code>is_empty()</code>: This method checks if the stack is empty, a useful operation before attempting to <code>pop()</code> or <code>top()</code> to prevent errors.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="time-complexity">Time Complexity</h4>
            <p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Operation</td>
                    <td>Average case</td>
                    <td>Worst case</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Access</td>
                    <td><code>O(n)</code></td>
                    <td><code>O(n)</code></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Insert (Push)</td>
                    <td><code>O(1)</code></td>
                    <td><code>O(1)</code></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Delete (Pop)</td>
                    <td><code>O(1)</code></td>
                    <td><code>O(1)</code></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Search</td>
                    <td><code>O(n)</code></td>
                    <td><code>O(n)</code></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            </p>
            <p>As can be seen, while push and pop operations are constant time, access (retrieving an element without popping) and search operations require linear time since, in the worst case, all elements must be inspected.</p>
            <h4 id="common-applications">Common Applications</h4>
            <p>Stacks are incredibly versatile and are used in a multitude of applications, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stack-oriented programming languages</strong> such as Forth and PostScript rely heavily on the stack data structure to perform operations.</li>
                <li>In <strong>graph algorithms</strong>, stacks are widely used in depth-first search (DFS) algorithms, where backtracking is necessary to explore unvisited nodes.</li>
                <li>When <strong>finding Eulerian cycles in graphs</strong>, stacks help keep track of the current path, as the cycle must visit every edge exactly once.</li>

            <p>Stacks can be implemented using various underlying data structures, but arrays and linked lists are among the most common due to their inherent characteristics which nicely complement the operations and needs of a stack.</p>
            <p>The choice between arrays and linked lists often depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as memory usage and the cost of operations. With an array, resizing can be expensive but access is faster, while with a linked list, insertion and deletion are faster but more memory is used due to the extra storage of pointers.</p>

            <h3 id="queues">Queues</h3>
            <p>A <em>queue</em> is a fundamental data structure that stores elements in a sequence, with modifications made by adding elements to the end (enqueuing) and removing them from the front (dequeuing). The queue follows a First In First Out (FIFO) strategy, implying that the oldest elements are processed first.</p>

            <p>The standard operations associated with a queue are:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><code>dequeue()</code>: This method returns the front element of the queue and simultaneously removes it.</li>
                <li><code>front()</code>: This method simply returns the front element without removing it from the queue, giving a peek at the next item to be dequeued.</li>
                <li><code>is_empty()</code>: This method checks if the queue is empty, an important step before calling <code>dequeue()</code> or <code>front()</code> to prevent errors.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The stack operates on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, while the queue follows a <strong>First-In-First-Out (FIFO)</strong> principle.</li>
                <li>In terms of <strong>accessibility</strong>, stacks allow access only to the top element, while queues provide access to both the front and rear elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Implementation</strong> of both stacks and queues can be done using arrays or linked lists, but queues can also be implemented using circular arrays, heaps, or double-ended queues (deques).</li>
                <li>In <strong>usage</strong>, stacks are ideal for reversing the order of elements, while queues are useful for maintaining the original order of elements.</li>

            <p>A <em>heap</em> is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. There are two main types of heaps: <em>max-heaps</em> and <em>min-heaps</em>. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>In a <em>max-heap</em>, the keys of parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those of the children, with the maximum key present at the root node.</li>
                <li>In a <em>min-heap</em>, the keys of parent nodes are always less than or equal to those of the children, with the minimum key present at the root node. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Heaps are always complete binary trees, which means they are filled at all levels, except the last, which is filled from left to right. This structure ensures that the heap remains balanced.</p>

            <p>Heaps can be represented efficiently using a one-dimensional array, which allows for easy calculation of the parent, left, and right child positions. The standard mapping from the heap to this array representation is as follows:</p>

            <p>A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of binary tree where each node has up to two children and maintains a specific ordering property among its values. For every node, the values of all nodes in its left subtree are less than its own value, and the values of all nodes in its right subtree are greater than its own value. In a well-balanced BST, this property enables efficient lookup, addition, and deletion operations, ideally distributing the nodes evenly across the left and right subtrees.

            <p>The secret to maintaining AVL trees' balance is the application of rotation operations. Four types of rotations can occur based on the tree's balance state:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Right rotation</strong> occurs when the left subtree of a node is taller than its right subtree. In this rotation, the node's left child becomes the new root, and the old root becomes the right child of this new root. The final step involves updating the heights of the affected nodes.</li>
                <li><strong>Left rotation</strong> is used when the right subtree of a node is taller than its left subtree. During this rotation, the node's right child becomes the new root, while the old root becomes the left child of the new root. Afterward, the nodes' heights are updated accordingly.</li>
                <li><strong>Right-left rotation</strong> is necessary when the right subtree of a node is taller, but the right child's left subtree is taller than its right subtree. This rotation involves first applying a right rotation on the right child, followed by a left rotation on the original node, with height updates for all affected nodes.</li>
                <li><strong>Left-right rotation</strong> is applied when the left subtree of a node is taller, and the left child's right subtree is taller than its left subtree. The process starts with a left rotation on the left child, followed by a right rotation on the original node, and concludes with height updates.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These rotations keep AVL trees balanced, ensuring consistent performance.</p>

            <p>Red-Black trees are a type of self-balancing binary search trees, with each node bearing an additional attribute: color. Each node in a Red-Black tree is colored either red or black, and these color attributes follow specific rules to maintain the tree's balance. This balance ensures that fundamental tree operations such as insertions, deletions, and searches remain efficient.</p>

            <p>Red-Black trees are a sophisticated binary search tree variant. They require careful management of node colors during insertions and deletions, often involving multiple rebalancing steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Standard BST insertion is performed initially.</li>
                <li>If the new node is the tree root, it's colored black to satisfy the Red-Black tree properties.</li>
                <li>If the new node's parent is black, no further action is needed.</li>
                <li>If the new node's parent is red, and its uncle (the sibling of its parent) is also red, both the parent and uncle are recolored black, and the grandparent is recolored red (if not the root). This step is known as "recoloring."</li>
                <li>If the new node's parent is red, but its uncle is black or NIL, the tree might need a rotation or a series of rotations. These rotations can be left, right, or a combination of both based on the relative placements of the new node, its parent, and its grandparent. These rotations aim to restructure the tree while preserving the BST property and restoring the Red-Black tree properties.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These careful rotations and recoloring steps enable Red-Black trees to maintain balance and ensure efficient performance across various operations.</p>

            <h4 id="common-applications">Common Applications</h4>
            <p>Hash tables are ubiquitous across various domains, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Databases and caching systems leverage hash tables to achieve quick insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.</li>
                <li>Networking applications use hash tables for rapid data retrieval and updates.</li>
                <li>They are employed within string searching algorithms, such as the Rabin-Karp algorithm, enabling efficient substring search.</li>
                <li>Data visualization often involves creating histograms, which use hash tables for binning data.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="implementation-details">Implementation Details</h4>
            <p>The creation of a hash table involves setting up a data structure to store key-value pairs, designing a hash function to map keys to slots in the data structure, and devising a collision resolution strategy to handle instances where multiple keys hash to the same slot. </p>
            <p>Common data structures used include arrays (for open addressing) and linked lists or balanced trees (for separate chaining).</p>
            <h5>Hash Function</h5>
            <p>A hash function takes a key (like a string) and turns it into a number, which then decides where to store the data in a table. The goal is to spread out the keys evenly so that no single spot gets overloaded. One simple method for strings is to add up the ASCII values of the characters and then use the remainder from dividing by the table size to pick a slot. Using prime numbers for the table size or in the calculations can help achieve a more balanced spread.</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-shell"># n: number of keys
# m: number of buckets 
h(x) = n % m</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <h5>Collision Resolution</h5>
            <p>Collisions occur when two or more keys hash to the same slot. There are two common strategies to handle these collisions: chaining and open addressing.</p>
            <h5>Chaining</h5>
            <p>With chaining, each slot or bucket in the hash table acts as a linked list. Each new key-value pair is appended to its designated list. While this approach allows for efficient insertions and deletions, the worst-case time complexity for lookups escalates to <code>O(n)</code>, where <code>n</code> is the number of keys stored.</p>
            <p>The following is an example:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-shell">index  Bucket
---------------------
0      -&gt; ["apple"]
1      -&gt; ["banana", "mango"]
2      -&gt; ["cherry"]
3      -&gt; []
4      -&gt; ["dates", "elderberry", "fig"]
...</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>In the above example, "banana" and "mango" hash to the same index (1), so they are stored in the same linked list.</p>
            <h5>Open Addressing</h5>
            <p>In open addressing, the hash table is an array, and each key-value pair is stored directly in an array slot. When a collision arises, the hash table searches for the next available slot according to a predefined probe sequence. Common probing techniques include linear probing, where the table checks each slot one by one, and quadratic probing, which checks slots based on a quadratic function of the distance from the original hash.</p>
            <p>Here's an example using linear probing:</p>
            <p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-shell">index  Bucket
---------------------
0      -&gt; "apple"
1      -&gt; "cherry"
2      -&gt; "banana"  (originally hashed to 1, moved due to collision)
3      -&gt; "mango"   (originally hashed to 1, moved due to collision)
4      -&gt; "dates"
5      -&gt; "elderberry"
6      -&gt; "fig"
...</code></pre>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>In this case, "banana" and "mango" were hashed to index 1, but since it was already occupied by "cherry", they were moved to the next available slots (2 and 3, respectively).</p>
