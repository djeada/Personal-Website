        <h2>Dynamic Programming</h2>
        <p>Dynamic programming is a method for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems, storing the solutions to these subproblems in a table, and using these stored solutions to solve larger problems. This approach can significantly reduce the time complexity of the algorithm, allowing it to solve problems much faster than a brute force solution.</p>
        <p>Dynamic programming works best for problems that have an optimal substructure, meaning that the optimal solution to a problem can be found by solving its subproblems optimally. This is particularly useful for problems that involve repeating subproblems, such as in the Fibonacci sequence or the knapsack problem.</p>
        <p>There are three main approaches to implementing dynamic programming: brute force recursion, memoized recursion, and tabulation.</p>
        <h3>Brute Force Recursion</h3>
        <p>Brute force recursion involves visualizing the problem as a tree of subproblems and implementing the tree using recursion. While this approach may be elegant and concise, it can suffer from exponential time complexity due to the repeated calculation of the same subproblems.</p>
        <h3>Memoized Recursion</h3>
        <p>Memoized recursion involves adding a hash map to store already computed subproblems, allowing for faster lookup and avoiding unnecessary recalculation. This can significantly improve the time complexity of the algorithm.</p>
        <h3>Tabulation</h3>
        <p>Tabulation involves visualizing the problem as a table and setting the elements of the table based on previously calculated values. This bottom-up approach allows for faster computation but requires manual selection of the order in which subproblems are calculated.</p>
        <h3>Why might we choose recursive solutions over iterative techniques with tabulation?</h3>
        <p>Overall, it is faster, but we must manually choose the order in which the subproblems must be calculated. That is frequently troublesome in and of itself. This is straightforward for fibonacci, but it quickly becomes challenging for more complicated dynamic programming problems. As a result, when it is not the bottleneck of our program or we do not expect large inputs, we are typically satisfied with recursive solutions. </p>
        <h2>Common terms explained</h2>
        <h3>Recursion</h3>
        <p>Recursion is a method of solving a problem by defining a function that calls itself with a smaller version of the same problem. This allows the function to break the problem down into smaller and smaller pieces until it reaches a base case, at which point it can begin to build a solution by combining the solutions to the smaller subproblems. Recursion is often used to solve problems that can be decomposed into smaller subproblems that are repeated, such as in the Fibonacci sequence or the Tower of Hanoi.</p>
        <h3>Subset</h3>
        <p>A subset is a collection of elements that belongs to a larger set. Every set is considered to be a subset of itself, and the empty set is a subset of every set. Subsets are often used in combinatorial mathematics to describe the possible combinations of elements that can be chosen from a larger set.</p>
        <h3>Subarray</h3>
        <p>A subarray is a contiguous portion of an array, or a sequence of elements within an array. A subarray is defined by its start and end indices, and can be extracted from the original array by using these indices to slice the array. Subarrays are often used in algorithms to perform operations on a portion of an array without affecting the rest of the array.</p>
        <h3>Substring</h3>
        <p>A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. Like a subarray, a substring is defined by its start and end indices, and can be extracted from the original string by using these indices to slice the string. Substrings are often used in algorithms to search for and manipulate specific sequences of characters within a string.</p>
        <h3>Subsequence</h3>
        <p>A subsequence is a sequence of elements within a larger sequence, such as a string or an array, that can be extracted by deleting some of the elements in the original sequence. A subsequence does not have to be contiguous, unlike a substring or a subarray, and the order of the elements in the subsequence may not be the same as the order in the original sequence. Subsequences are often used in algorithms to identify patterns or trends within a larger sequence of data.</p>
