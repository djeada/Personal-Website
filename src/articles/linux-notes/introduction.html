                    <p><strong>1987</strong>: Andrew S. Tanenbaum introduces MINIX, a simplified UNIX-like system intended for academic use. This system indirectly sparks the development of Linux by inspiring Linus Torvalds.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>1991</strong>: Linus Torvalds, a student at the University of Helsinki, releases the first version of the Linux kernel. It is a small, experimental project that initially only runs on the same type of computer that Torvalds himself used.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>1993</strong>: Torvalds agrees to license the Linux kernel under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This makes it legally part of the Free Software ecosystem, and guarantees that it will remain free and open-source.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>1998</strong>: Red Hat Linux is released, becoming one of the most popular and influential Linux distributions. It plays a key role in the growth of Linux use in businesses and the establishment of the enterprise Linux market.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>2004</strong>: The Linux Foundation is formed, consolidating various organizations supporting Linux. It serves to sponsor the work of Linux creator Linus Torvalds and lead collaborative development on the Linux kernel and other open-source projects.</p>

            <h2 id="understanding-a-linux-distribution">Understanding a Linux Distribution</h2>
            <p>A Linux distribution, often simply referred to as a "distro," is a particular variant of Linux that packages together the Linux kernel and a variety of additional software to create a fully functional operating system. </p>
            <p>Each distribution includes:
                - <strong>Linux Kernel</strong>: The core part of the distribution, responsible for managing hardware, processes, memory, and peripherals.
                - <strong>Libraries</strong>: These provide a set of standard functions, such as input/output processing, mathematical computations, and other functionalities that can be used by various programs.
                - <strong>System Daemons</strong>: These are background services (or "daemons") that start up at boot time to provide necessary system functionalities such as logging, task scheduling, network management, and more.
                - <strong>Development and Packaging Tools</strong>: Tools for compiling and managing software packages are also included to facilitate software installation and updates.
                - <strong>Life-cycle Management Utilities</strong>: Utilities for managing system updates, configuring system settings, and monitoring system health are also part of the distribution.</p>
            <p>Before a distribution is released, all of these components are thoroughly tested together for compatibility and interoperability. This ensures a seamless user experience and functionality.</p>
            <p>Linux distributions can be installed and run on a wide range of hardware, including servers, desktops, laptops, and more. They come in numerous variants each tailored for specific user groups or usage scenarios.</p>
            <p>Examples of popular Linux distributions include:
                - <strong>Ubuntu</strong>: Known for its user-friendly nature, it's often recommended for Linux beginners.
                - <strong>Debian</strong>: Renowned for its stability, Debian is often used in servers and forms the base for other distributions such as Ubuntu.
                - <strong>Fedora</strong>: As a cutting-edge distribution, Fedora often includes the latest software technologies and is sponsored by Red Hat.
                - <strong>openSUSE</strong>: Known for its robustness and versatility, openSUSE is suitable for both servers and desktops.
                - <strong>Cumulus Linux</strong>: This is a Linux distribution specifically designed for networking hardware.</p>
