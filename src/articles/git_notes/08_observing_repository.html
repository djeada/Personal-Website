            <h2 id="checking-and-understanding-changes">Checking and Understanding Changes</h2>
            <p>Git offers several ways to inspect and understand what has changed in your codebase. Mastering these commands helps you monitor progress, spot issues early, and keep your project history organized. Think of it like reading the "track changes" feature in a word processor—but for your entire code project.</p>
            <h3 id="viewing-changes">Viewing Changes</h3>
            <p>Different Git commands let you look at what’s been modified, who made the changes, and exactly how your files differ now from previous versions. Having a solid grasp of these tools makes your collaboration and debugging sessions a lot more efficient.</p>
            <h4 id="list-uncommitted-files">List Uncommitted Files</h4>
            <p>To list uncommitted files, use:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">git status</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>It shows you which files are tracked, which are untracked, and which have been modified since your last commit. It also tells you which files are in the staging area.</p>
            <p>Example Output:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-shell">On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   index.html

Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
	newscript.js</code></pre>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><code>modified: index.html</code> means <code>index.html</code> is being tracked by Git but has changes not yet staged.</li>
                <li><code>newscript.js</code> is untracked, so Git doesn’t know about it yet. You’ll need to stage it before committing.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="view-unstaged-changes">View Unstaged Changes</h4>
            <p>To view unstaged changes, use:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">git diff</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>It compares your working directory (the files you’re actively editing) to the staging area. It highlights the lines that have been added, removed, or changed but are not yet staged for commit.</p>
            <p>Example Output:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-shell">diff --git a/style.css b/style.css
index f7c2963..3e0f18e 100644

            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>Lines prefixed with a <code>+</code> sign indicate new additions (<code>color: #333;</code> and <code>font-family: Arial, sans-serif;</code>).</li>
                <li>Lines prefixed with a <code>-</code> sign would show removed code.</li>
                <li>The context lines show surrounding code for reference.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="see-staged-but-uncommitted-changes">See Staged but Uncommitted Changes</h4>
            <p>To see staged but uncomitted changes, use:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">git diff --cached</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p><code>git diff --cached</code> (sometimes written as <code>git diff --staged</code>) lets you see the differences between what’s in the staging area and the last commit. This way, you know exactly which changes will go into your next commit.</p>
            <p>Example Usage and Output:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-shell"># Stage a file first
git add style.css

# Then check the staged changes
git diff --cached</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>You might see output similar to the previous example, but only for <code>style.css</code> if that’s the file you staged.</p>
            <p>This is useful for a final check before committing, ensuring you don’t accidentally include changes you’re not ready to commit.</p>
            <h4 id="inspect-all-changes-since-the-last-commit">Inspect All Changes Since the Last Commit</h4>
            <p>To inspect all changes since the last commit, use:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">git diff HEAD</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>It compares everything in your working directory and staging area to the most recent commit (<code>HEAD</code>). It’s like an all-in-one snapshot of what’s changed, both staged and unstaged, since you last committed.</p>
            <p>If you see output showing differences in multiple files, that’s Git telling you, “Here’s what’s changed everywhere since your last commit.”</p>
            <p>This provides a broad overview. It’s a quick way to review all modifications before deciding what to stage and commit.</p>
            <h4 id="highlight-word-level-changes">Highlight Word-Level Changes</h4>
            <p>To highlight word-level changes, use:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">git diff --word-diff</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>By default, <code>git diff</code> compares changes line by line. When you add <code>--word-diff</code>, Git breaks down each line further, highlighting exactly which words or tokens have changed.</p>
            <p>Example Output:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-shell">@@ -5,7 +5,7 @@
 Here is some text that has changed a little.

 - This is the old line
 + This is the new line</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>Instead of simply showing a whole line as changed, <code>--word-diff</code> zeroes in on the specific words you altered. If you often fix minor typos or modify small text segments, this command saves you from scanning entire lines to find those tiny tweaks.</p>
            <h4 id="audit-a-file-s-change-history">Audit a File's Change History</h4>
            <p>To audit a file's change history, use:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">git blame filename</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>It shows you who last modified each line of a file, along with the commit hash and timestamp. It’s helpful when you’re curious about why a particular change was made or who to ask about it.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">git blame index.html</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>You’ll see something like:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-shell">a4d6e439 (Alice   2025-04-01 10:12:56) &lt;header&gt;
d35f7abc (Bob     2025-04-02 14:33:10)   &lt;h1&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;
a4d6e439 (Alice   2025-04-01 10:12:56) &lt;/header&gt;</code></pre>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>Each line is listed with the commit hash (<code>a4d6e439</code>), the author’s name (<code>Alice</code>), the date/time, and the code snippet.</li>
                <li>This is especially good for pinpointing when (and who) introduced a bug or feature.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="viewing-changes-in-a-specific-file">Viewing Changes in a Specific File</h4>
            <p>To viewing changes in a specific file, use:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">git diff filename</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>By specifying a filename, you can focus on changes in just that file, ignoring the rest of the codebase. This is handy if you have a large project but only want to review a single file’s modifications.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">git diff style.css</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>If you have many files updated across your repo, but you’re only concerned about <code>style.css</code>, you can run this command to zero in on those changes and not get distracted by others.</p>
            <h3 id="comparing-commits">Comparing Commits</h3>
            <p>Git offers various ways to look at differences between commits, so you can see how your project has evolved over time. If you want to find out when a piece of code was introduced or track how a function has changed, these commands will get you there quickly.</p>
            <h4 id="visualize-commit-history">Visualize Commit History</h4>
            <p>To visualize commit history, use:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">git log</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>Displays a chronological list of commits with messages, authors, and dates. It’s like a timeline that shows how your codebase reached its current state.</p>
            <p>Example Output (Shortened):</p>

                <pre><code class="language-bash">git diff a1b2c3d4 e5f6g7h8</code></pre>
