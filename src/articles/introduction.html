        <h2>Why should you learn Linux?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Future relevance:
                    Linux has seen continuous growth in business-critical usage since its inception 30 years ago and is likely to remain the most popular operating system in the foreseeable future.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Wide usage:
                    Linux is used in a variety of devices and systems, including most web servers, the majority of the world's top supercomputers, many Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and Tesla cars. Android is also based on Linux. Unix-like operating systems, such as Playstation OS, Mac OS, and OS X, also draw inspiration from Linux.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Hardware support:
                    The Linux kernel is designed to run on a wide range of hardware.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Software availability:
                    Linux has a large selection of available software, including many apps that have been ported from Windows and Mac.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Adaptability:
                    Linux's open-source nature and modularity make it a versatile choice for a variety of applications. It can be used to control water temperature, run appliances that transport packets over a business network, or as a desktop operating system.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Strong community and ecosystem:
                    The open-source nature of Linux has contributed to its success, as many developers contribute code to improve the operating system. There are online forums and communities, Linux teachers, training courses, blogs, third-party tools, and conferences dedicated to Linux.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Affordability for a new business:
                    As a new business, Linux can be a cost-effective choice for running a website, database, and other applications. It is easy to install, use, and upgrade, and it is straightforward to deploy and maintain applications with Linux.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>History of Linux</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1971: First release of UNIX</li>
            <li>1983: The GNU Project (standing for "GNU's Not Unix") was founded to develop a fully UNIX-compatible operating system.</li>
            <li>1987: MINIX, a UNIX-like operating system for students, was released, but its license limited its distribution.</li>
            <li>1991: Linus Torvalds releases the Linux kernel.</li>
            <li>1993: The Linux kernel was licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</li>
            <li>1998: The first version of the popular Linux distribution, Red Hat Linux, was released.</li>
            <li>2004: The Linux Foundation was formed to support the growth and development of the Linux operating system.</li>
            <li>2011: Linux reached a significant milestone with the release of the 3.0 kernel, which marked the end of the 2.x kernel series.</li>
            <li>2015: The Linux kernel reached version 4.0, which introduced support for new hardware and features such as live patching and support for the BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) virtual machine.</li>
            <li>2017: The Linux kernel reached version 4.14, which introduced support for AMD's Secure Memory Encryption technology and the BPF-based XDP (eXpress Data Path) networking stack.</li>
            <li>2020: The Linux kernel reached version 5.10, which introduced support for hardware-accelerated virtualization on ARM processors and support for AMD's Zen 3 processors.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What is a distribution?</h2>
        <p>A Linux distribution is a combination of specific versions of the Linux kernel, libraries, system daemons, development and packaging tools, and life-cycle management utilities that are compatible and tested for interoperability. Distributions can be downloaded and used on a wide range of devices, including servers, desktops, and laptops. Some examples of Linux distributions include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, and Cumulus Linux.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>What is the difference between a Linux distribution and a Linux kernel?</li>
            <li>Where can you find a Linux distribution to download?</li>
            <li>Is Linux the same as UNIX?</li>
            <li>Is every Linux distribution free?</li>
        </ol>
