            <h2 id="history-of-linux">History of Linux</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1971: First release of UNIX</li>
                <li>1983: The GNU Project (standing for "GNU's Not Unix") was founded to develop a fully UNIX-compatible operating system.</li>
                <li>1987: MINIX, a UNIX-like operating system for students, was released, but its license limited its distribution.</li>
                <li>1991: Linus Torvalds releases the Linux kernel.</li>
                <li>1993: The Linux kernel was licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</li>
                <li>1998: The first version of the popular Linux distribution, Red Hat Linux, was released.</li>
                <li>2004: The Linux Foundation was formed to support the growth and development of the Linux operating system.</li>
                <li>2011: Linux reached a significant milestone with the release of the 3.0 kernel, which marked the end of the 2.x kernel series.</li>
                <li>2015: The Linux kernel reached version 4.0, which introduced support for new hardware and features such as live patching and support for the BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) virtual machine.</li>
                <li>2017: The Linux kernel reached version 4.14, which introduced support for AMD's Secure Memory Encryption technology and the BPF-based XDP (eXpress Data Path) networking stack.</li>
                <li>2020: The Linux kernel reached version 5.10, which introduced support for hardware-accelerated virtualization on ARM processors and support for AMD's Zen 3 processors.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="what-is-a-distribution-">What is a distribution?</h2>
            <p>A Linux distribution is a combination of specific versions of the Linux kernel, libraries, system daemons, development and packaging tools, and life-cycle management utilities that are compatible and tested for interoperability. Distributions can be downloaded and used on a wide range of devices, including servers, desktops, and laptops. Some examples of Linux distributions include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, and Cumulus Linux.</p>
