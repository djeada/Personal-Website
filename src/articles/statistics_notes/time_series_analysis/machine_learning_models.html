        <p>When it comes to forecasting time series data, selecting the right machine learning model can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of predictions. These notes provide a comprehensive overview of some of the most commonly used algorithms in the field, each with its unique strengths and limitations.</p>
        <p>The table below compares several time series forecasting algorithms, highlighting their descriptions, advantages, disadvantages, and whether they can be applied locally or globally:</p>
        <p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Algorithm Name</td>
                <td>Description</td>
                <td>Pros</td>
                <td>Cons</td>
                <td>Local vs Global</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)</strong></td>
                <td>A statistical model used for analyzing and forecasting time series data by using the dependencies between an observation and a number of lagged observations.</td>
                <td>- Flexible and capable of handling a wide range of time series patterns. <br /> - Suitable for univariate time series data.</td>
                <td>- Complex to understand and implement. <br /> - Requires the data to be stationary. <br /> - Sensitive to the chosen parameters. <br /> - AutoARIMA can alleviate some implementation challenges but still requires expertise.</td>
                <td>Local only. Cannot be used globally.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Prophet</strong></td>
                <td>Developed by Facebook, this algorithm is tailored for forecasting time series data with daily observations that include strong seasonal effects and the presence of outliers.</td>
                <td>- Easy to use with intuitive parameter settings. <br /> - Automatically handles missing data and outliers well. <br /> - Provides a simple and interpretable result.</td>
                <td>- Less effective for non-daily data or data without strong seasonality. <br /> - Requires domain knowledge to fine-tune accurately. <br /> - Has faced criticism after issues with high-profile predictions (e.g., Zillow collapse).</td>
                <td>Local only. Cannot be used globally.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)</strong></td>
                <td>A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for learning from sequences and time series data, capable of capturing long-term dependencies.</td>
                <td>- Excellent at capturing long-term dependencies and patterns in time series data. <br /> - Can handle large and complex datasets.</td>
                <td>- Requires substantial amounts of data for training. <br /> - Computationally intensive and can be slow to train. <br /> - Complex architecture that requires careful tuning of hyperparameters.</td>
                <td>Can be used locally or globally.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Holt-Winters Method</strong></td>
                <td>A time series forecasting method that accounts for level, trend, and seasonality by applying exponential smoothing.</td>
                <td>- Good for data with trend and seasonal patterns. <br /> - Straightforward and relatively easy to implement.</td>
                <td>- May not perform well on non-seasonal data. <br /> - Sensitive to parameter choices and initial settings.</td>
                <td>Local only. Cannot be used globally.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)</strong></td>
                <td>An extension of ARIMA that includes seasonal components, enabling it to handle seasonal effects in the data.</td>
                <td>- Capable of handling both trend and seasonality in the data. <br /> - Flexible model structure that can be tailored to specific time series characteristics.</td>
                <td>- Complex to configure and requires a thorough understanding of time series analysis. <br /> - Data must be stationary, requiring transformations. <br /> - AutoARIMA can assist but still demands expertise.</td>
                <td>Local only. Cannot be used globally.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Exponential Smoothing</strong></td>
                <td>A forecasting technique that applies weighted averages to past observations, with the weights decaying exponentially over time.</td>
                <td>- Simple to implement and use. <br /> - Effective for data without clear trend or seasonal patterns.</td>
                <td>- May not be accurate for more complex data involving trends and seasonality. <br /> - Struggles with data exhibiting sudden changes or volatility.</td>
                <td>Local only. Cannot be used globally.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Random Forest</strong></td>
                <td>An ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance and robustness.</td>
                <td>- Handles a wide variety of data types and is robust to outliers. <br /> - Can detect complex interactions and dependencies in the data.</td>
                <td>- Computationally intensive, especially for large datasets. <br /> - Can overfit if not properly tuned. <br /> - Does not extrapolate beyond the range of training data.</td>
                <td>Can be used locally or globally.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>XGBoost</strong></td>
                <td>A highly efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting, particularly effective for structured data and competitions.</td>
                <td>- High performance with excellent predictive power. <br /> - Handles a wide range of data types well, including complex seasonality. <br /> - Offers extensive tuning options and regularization techniques to improve accuracy.</td>
                <td>- Can be complex to tune and requires careful parameter selection to avoid overfitting. <br /> - Computationally demanding. <br /> - Cannot predict values outside the range of training data (above max or below min).</td>
                <td>Can be used locally or globally.</td>
