            <ol>
                <li>In a poll of 1,200 registered voters, 45% preferred candidate A over candidate B.</li>
                <li>The <strong>population</strong> in this case is all registered voters in the country.</li>

            <h4 id="types-of-biases">Types of Biases</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Selection bias</strong> occurs when participants are not randomly selected, leading to unrepresentative samples, such as excluding non-internet users in an online survey.</li>
                <li><strong>Sampling bias</strong> arises when certain population segments have a lower likelihood of being included in the sample than others.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-response bias</strong> happens when individuals in the sample do not respond, potentially skewing the data based on the non-responders' characteristics.</li>
                <li><strong>Measurement bias</strong> involves systematic errors in data collection, often due to the use of inaccurate measurement tools or methods.</li>
                <li><strong>Observer bias</strong> refers to subjective influences by the researcher during data collection or interpretation, such as when placebo effects alter the outcomes in clinical trials.</li>
                <li><strong>Survivorship bias</strong> emphasizes only the elements that "survive" a process, disregarding those that did not, as seen when analyzing only successful companies.</li>
                <li><strong>Confirmation bias</strong> occurs when researchers prefer data that supports their hypothesis and overlook data that contradicts it.</li>
                <li><strong>Recall bias</strong> arises when participants provide inaccurate retrospective data due to faulty memory.</li>
                <li><strong>Publication bias</strong> occurs when studies are more likely to be published if they have positive or significant results, leading to a skew in the research literature.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="strategies-to-counteract-bias">Strategies to Counteract Bias</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Random sampling</strong> ensures that every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, reducing the risk of selection bias.</li>
                <li><strong>Stratified sampling</strong> involves dividing the population into homogeneous groups (strata) and sampling from each, ensuring better representation.</li>
                <li><strong>Systematic sampling</strong> uses a fixed interval to select participants, though care must be taken to avoid alignment with population patterns that could introduce bias.</li>
                <li><strong>Cluster sampling</strong> is effective when populations are large or geographically spread out; it involves randomly selecting clusters and then sampling all elements within those clusters.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="variables-and-data">Variables and Data</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>variable</strong> is the specific characteristic or attribute that researchers are interested in measuring or analyzing. Variables can represent things like age, height, income, or any measurable trait in a study.</li>
                <li><strong>Data</strong> refers to the actual values or observations that are collected for variables. These can be numbers, categories, or measurements, and they form the basis of statistical analysis.</li>
                <li>The <strong>population</strong> is the entire group of individuals or items that researchers want to understand or make conclusions about. This could be all people living in a country, all trees in a forest, or all manufactured products from a factory.</li>
                <li>A <strong>parameter</strong> is a summary value that describes something about the entire population. For example, the average height of all adult men in a country is a parameter. Since it's often impractical to collect data from every individual, parameters are usually estimated.</li>
                <li>A <strong>sample</strong> is a smaller subset of the population that researchers collect data from. Studying the entire population may be impossible or costly, so a sample is used to make estimates about the population.</li>
                <li>A <strong>statistic</strong> is a summary value calculated from a sample. It is used to estimate the population parameter. For instance, the average height calculated from a sample of adult men is a statistic.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="visualization-of-data-collection-from-a-group">Visualization of Data Collection from a Group</h4>
            <p>Imagine a group of individuals, each with unique attributes to be measured:</p>

            <h4 id="parameter-vs-statistic">Parameter vs. Statistic</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>parameter</strong> refers to a value that describes an entire population, such as the average height of all people in a city. </li>
                <li>The <strong>population mean</strong> ($\mu$) is an example of a parameter, representing the average of a numerical variable across the whole population.</li>
                <li>Another example of a parameter is the <strong>population standard deviation</strong> ($\sigma$), which measures the spread or variability of a numerical variable in the population.</li>
                <li>A <strong>statistic</strong> is a value calculated from a sample of the population, such as the average height of a subset of individuals. It is used to estimate the corresponding population parameter.</li>
                <li>The <strong>sample mean</strong> ($\bar{x}$) is an example of a statistic, representing the average of a numerical variable within a sample.</li>
                <li>Similarly, the <strong>sample standard deviation</strong> ($s$) is a statistic that measures the spread of a numerical variable in the sample.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="example-application-of-parameters-and-statistics">Example: Application of Parameters and Statistics</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Suppose researchers want to find the average income of all adults in a large city. The <strong>population</strong> is all adults in the city, and the <strong>parameter</strong> of interest is the average income.</li>
                <li>Since itâ€™s impractical to collect income data from every adult, they take a <strong>sample</strong> of 500 adults. The average income from this sample is calculated as the <strong>statistic</strong>.</li>
                <li>Using this sample statistic, researchers estimate the <strong>population parameter</strong>â€”the average income for all adults in the city.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This process of using a <strong>statistic</strong> to estimate a <strong>parameter</strong> is foundational in inferential statistics, allowing researchers to draw conclusions about large populations from manageable samples.</p>
            <h4 id="classification-of-variables">Classification of Variables</h4>
            <p>Variables are broadly categorized into two types: Numerical and Categorical.</p>

            </p>
            <h4 id="numerical-variables">Numerical Variables</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Numerical variables represent data consisting of numbers, allowing for meaningful arithmetic operations.</li>
                <li>A <strong>discrete numerical variable</strong> refers to data that takes on distinct, separate values, typically representing counts or whole numbers. An example is the <strong>number of children</strong> in a family, which can only be a whole number.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Name</strong> is a categorical variable representing individuals' names.</li>
                <li><strong>Age</strong> is a numerical variable, specifically discrete, as it represents the whole number of years.</li>
                <li><strong>Height (inches)</strong> is a numerical variable, specifically continuous, as it can include fractional measurements.</li>
                <li><strong>Income ($)</strong> is a numerical variable, specifically continuous, since income can take any value within a range.</li>
                <li><strong>Education Level</strong> is a categorical variable that classifies individuals based on their highest educational achievement.</li>
                <li><strong>Marital Status</strong> is a categorical variable, representing different categories of relationship status.</li>

            <h4 id="explanatory-and-response-variables">Explanatory and Response Variables</h4>
            <p>Explanatory Variable (Independent Variable):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In a study, the <strong>explanatory variable</strong> is the one manipulated or selected to observe its effect on another variable.</li>
                <li>This variable, often represented as "X," plays a key role in determining outcomes in both experimental and observational research.</li>
                <li>For example, if researchers are interested in how study duration affects exam performance, the <strong>explanatory variable</strong> would be the amount of time spent studying.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Response Variable (Dependent Variable):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>response variable</strong> is the outcome that researchers measure to see how it is influenced by the explanatory variable.</li>
                <li>This variable is usually denoted as "Y" and reflects the effect or result of changes in the explanatory variable.</li>
                <li>For instance, in the context of study duration affecting exam performance, the <strong>response variable</strong> would be the exam scores.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Practical Illustration:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In a study at Elmswood University, researchers examined the impact of study duration on exam scores. The <strong>explanatory variable</strong> in this case was study time, either manipulated or naturally observed.</li>
                <li>The <strong>response variable</strong>, which was measured to see the effect of study duration, was the exam scores.</li>
                <li>This research focused on exploring how variations in study duration influenced academic performance.</li>
