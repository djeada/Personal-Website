            <h3 id="the-normal-curve">The Normal Curve</h3>
            <p>A <strong>normal distribution</strong> (often referred to as the <em>normal curve</em> or <em>Gaussian distribution</em>) is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, where most of the observations cluster around the central peak and taper off symmetrically towards both ends. Many real-world datasets such as human heights, IQ scores, and measurement errors exhibit this kind of distribution.</p>
            <p>The probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution is given by:</p>
            <p>$$
                f(x | \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{ -\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} }
                $$</p>
            <p>where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>$\mu$ is the mean,</li>
                <li>$\sigma^2$ is the variance (with $\sigma$ being the standard deviation),</li>
                <li>$e$ is Euler's number,</li>
                <li>$\pi$ is the constant Pi.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This formula describes the shape of the curve mathematically. The mean $\mu$ determines the center of the distribution, and the standard deviation $\sigma$ determines the width of the bell curve.</p>
            <p><img alt="output" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32acef3f-7617-464c-9527-31ea78679bda" /></p>
            <h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The distribution of adult <strong>heights</strong> usually follows a normal pattern, where most individuals cluster around the average height, with fewer people being much shorter or taller.</li>
                <li>When it comes to <strong>IQ scores</strong>, they are designed to follow a normal distribution, with the average score set at 100 and a standard deviation of 15, meaning most people score close to this mean.</li>
                <li>Not all data sets are normally distributed; for example, <strong>incomes</strong> tend to be skewed because a small proportion of people earn extremely high salaries, which significantly raises the overall average.</li>
                <li>Similarly, <strong>house prices</strong> are often skewed, as a small number of very expensive properties can disproportionately affect the overall data, making the mean house price higher than what most people actually pay.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="the-empirical-rule-68-95-99-7-rule-">The Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule)</h3>
            <p>The <strong>Empirical Rule</strong> provides a rough estimate for the spread of data in a normal distribution. It applies to any dataset that approximately follows the normal distribution.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>68% of the data</strong> falls within <strong>1 standard deviation</strong> of the mean, i.e., between $\mu - \sigma$ and $\mu + \sigma$.</li>
                <li><strong>95% of the data</strong> falls within <strong>2 standard deviations</strong> of the mean, i.e., between $\mu - 2\sigma$ and $\mu + 2\sigma$.</li>
                <li><strong>99.7% of the data</strong> falls within <strong>3 standard deviations</strong> of the mean, i.e., between $\mu - 3\sigma$ and $\mu + 3\sigma$.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="example">Example</h4>
            <p>Suppose we have a dataset where the heights of fathers are normally distributed with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mean height $\mu = 68.3$ inches,</li>
                <li>Standard deviation $\sigma = 1.8$ inches.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>According to the Empirical Rule:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>About <strong>68%</strong> of the heights will lie between $68.3 - 1.8 = 66.5$ inches and $68.3 + 1.8 = 70.1$ inches.</li>
                <li>About <strong>95%</strong> of the heights will lie between $68.3 - 2(1.8) = 64.7$ inches and $68.3 + 2(1.8) = 71.9$ inches.</li>
                <li>About <strong>99.7%</strong> of the heights will lie between $68.3 - 3(1.8) = 62.9$ inches and $68.3 + 3(1.8) = 73.7$ inches.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These intervals can be visualized as follows:</p>
            <p>$$
                \text{Interval} \quad \mu \pm n\sigma \quad \text{Proportion of Data Contained}
                $$</p>
            <p>$$
                \mu \pm \sigma \quad (66.5 \text{ to } 70.1) \quad \approx 68\%
                $$</p>
            <p>$$
                \mu \pm 2\sigma \quad (64.7 \text{ to } 71.9) \quad \approx 95\%
                $$</p>
            <p>$$
                \mu \pm 3\sigma \quad (62.9 \text{ to } 73.7) \quad \approx 99.7\%
                $$</p>

            <h3 id="standardizing-data-and-z-scores">Standardizing Data and Z-Scores</h3>
            <p>To compare values from different normal distributions or to work with a standardized form of a dataset, we can convert raw data values to <strong>z-scores</strong>.</p>
            <h4 id="definition-of-z-score">Definition of Z-Score</h4>
            <p>The <strong>z-score</strong> is a way of describing a value in terms of how many standard deviations it is away from the mean. The formula for the z-score is:</p>
            <p>$$
                z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
                $$</p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>$x$ is the raw score (the value you are standardizing),</li>
                <li>$\mu$ is the mean of the dataset,</li>
                <li>$\sigma$ is the standard deviation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A z-score tells us:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>$z = 0$: The value is exactly at the mean.</li>
                <li>$z &gt; 0$: The value is above the mean.</li>
                <li>$z &lt; 0$: The value is below the mean.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="example">Example</h4>
            <p>Suppose a father is 71.9 inches tall. We want to find his z-score given that the mean height is 68.3 inches and the standard deviation is 1.8 inches.</p>
            <p>$$
                z = \frac{71.9 - 68.3}{1.8} = \frac{3.6}{1.8} = 2
                $$</p>
            <p>This means that a height of 71.9 inches is 2 standard deviations above the mean.</p>
            <p>Conversely, if a father is 67.4 inches tall:</p>
            <p>$$
                z = \frac{67.4 - 68.3}{1.8} = \frac{-0.9}{1.8} = -0.5
                $$</p>
            <p>This means that a height of 67.4 inches is 0.5 standard deviations below the mean.</p>
            <h4 id="standard-normal-distribution">Standard Normal Distribution</h4>
            <p>After converting all values in a normal distribution to z-scores, we obtain the <strong>standard normal distribution</strong>, which has:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A mean $\mu = 0$,</li>
                <li>A standard deviation $\sigma = 1$.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The standard normal distribution is often used in statistics because it allows for easy computation of probabilities and comparison across different datasets.</p>
            <h3 id="finding-areas-under-the-normal-curve">Finding Areas Under the Normal Curve</h3>
            <p>To find the proportion of data within a certain range, we can use <strong>z-scores</strong> to convert the raw data points and then look up the corresponding probabilities using a <strong>z-table</strong> or statistical software. The area under the normal curve between two z-scores represents the proportion of data that lies between those values.</p>
            <h4 id="example">Example</h4>
            <p>To find the proportion of fathers with heights between 67.4 inches and 71.9 inches, we first compute the z-scores for these heights:</p>
            <p>For 67.4 inches:</p>
            <p>$$
                z_{67.4} = \frac{67.4 - 68.3}{1.8} = -0.5
                $$</p>
            <p>For 71.9 inches:</p>
            <p>$$
                z_{71.9} = \frac{71.9 - 68.3}{1.8} = 2
                $$</p>
            <p>Next, using a z-table (or software), we find the area to the left of these z-scores:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The area to the left of $z = -0.5$ is approximately <strong>0.3085</strong> (30.85%).</li>
                <li>The area to the left of $z = 2$ is approximately <strong>0.9772</strong> (97.72%).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thus, the proportion of fathers with heights between 67.4 and 71.9 inches is:</p>
            <p>$$
                P(67.4 \leq \text{height} \leq 71.9) = 0.9772 - 0.3085 = 0.6687 \approx 66.87\%
                $$</p>
            <p><img alt="output(2)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58bfcf9b-5769-4e49-af1c-7cced5a44195" /></p>
            <h3 id="computing-percentiles">Computing Percentiles</h3>
            <p>The <strong>percentile</strong> of a value in a normal distribution tells us the percentage of the data that is less than or equal to that value. To compute percentiles, we:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Find the z-score corresponding to the desired percentile using a z-table or statistical software.</li>
                <li>Convert the z-score back into the raw data value.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4 id="example">Example</h4>
            <p>Suppose we want to compute the <strong>30th percentile</strong> of fathers' heights. Using a z-table, we find that the z-score corresponding to the 30th percentile is approximately $z = -0.52$.</p>
            <p>To find the corresponding height, we use the z-score formula in reverse:</p>
            <p>$$
                \text{height} = \mu + z\sigma = 68.3 + (-0.52)(1.8) = 68.3 - 0.936 = 67.364 \text{ inches}.
                $$</p>
            <p>Thus, the 30th percentile corresponds to a height of approximately <strong>67.36 inches</strong>.</p>
            <p>This process can be applied to any percentile by finding the appropriate z-score and converting it back to the original scale using the mean and standard deviation of the dataset.</p>
