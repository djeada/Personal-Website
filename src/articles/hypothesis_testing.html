            <h2 id="hypothesis-testing">Hypothesis Testing</h2>
            <p>Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that allows you to make inferences about a population based on sample data. The process involves stating a null hypothesis, which assumes that there is no significant relationship or effect between the variables being tested. The alternative hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that there is a significant relationship or effect.</p>
            <h3 id="null-hypothesis-h0-and-alternative-hypothesis-h1-">Null Hypothesis (H0) and Alternative Hypothesis (H1)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Null Hypothesis (H0): Assumes nothing interesting is going on between the variables being tested. For example, if you wanted to test whether the average age of voters in your state differs from the national average, the null hypothesis would be that there is no difference between the average ages.</li>
                <li>Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Represents the opposite of the null hypothesis, stating that there is a significant relationship or effect. Continuing the example above, the alternative hypothesis would be that the average age of voters in your state does differ from the national average.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="significance-level-Î±-">Significance Level (Î±)</h3>
            <p>The significance level, often denoted by the Greek letter Î±, is a probability threshold that determines when you reject the null hypothesis. A common significance level is 0.05, meaning that there is a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.</p>
            <h3 id="p-value">P-Value</h3>
            <p>The p-value represents the probability of observing an effect as extreme or more extreme than the one observed, given that the null hypothesis is true. In other words, it measures the rarity of an event under the assumption of the null hypothesis. If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (Î±), you reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.</p>
            <p>$$
                \text{P-Value} = P(X \geq x \,|\, H_0)
                $$</p>
            <h3 id="t-test">T-Test</h3>
            <p>The T-test is a statistical test used to determine whether a numeric data sample differs significantly from the population or whether two samples differ from one another.</p>
            <h4>Interpretation</h4>
            <p>When interpreting the results of hypothesis testing, it's important to understand the meaning of the p-value:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A low p-value (less than the chosen significance level) indicates that the null hypothesis is unlikely, and you reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.</li>
                <li>A high p-value (greater than the chosen significance level) suggests that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, so you accept it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Keep in mind that the p-value should be used cautiously, as it can be subject to misuse and misinterpretation, such as p-hacking or making improper decisions based on its value.</p>
