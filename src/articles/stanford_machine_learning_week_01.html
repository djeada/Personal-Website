        <h2>Introduction to machine learning</h2>
        <p>Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions based on data and experience, without being explicitly programmed. It involves training algorithms on a set of labeled data, allowing the algorithm to make predictions or take actions based on new input. There are several types of machine learning, including supervised learning, in which the algorithm is provided with a set of labeled examples to learn from, and unsupervised learning, in which the algorithm is not given any labeled examples and must find patterns and relationships in the data on its own. Machine learning has numerous applications, including in database mining, autonomous systems, handwriting recognition, natural language processing, and self-customizing programs.</p>
        <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Deep learning‚Äôs rise is being driven by several major factors.</li>
            <li>Deep learning in supervised learning.</li>
            <li>The major types of models (such as CNNs and RNNs) and when they should be used.</li>
            <li>When is deep learning appropriate to use?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why is ML so prevalent?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It is a branch in artificial intelligence.</li>
            <li>We aim to build a machine that can ‚Äùthink.‚Äù</li>
            <li>Machines may be programmed to do mathematical tasks.</li>
            <li>It is impossible (for us) to create AI based on set of rules.</li>
            <li>We want robots to discover such rules on their own, to learn from the data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <p>Machine learning has exploded in popularity as a result of the huge amount of data generated and colected in recent years.</p>
        <h3>Database mining sources</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Data from the internet (click-stream or click through data). Mine to better understand users. This is common in Silicon Valley.</li>
            <li>Medical records. More and more data is being saved electronically.</li>
            <li>Biological data. Gene sequences, ML algorithms improve our understanding of the human genome.</li>
            <li>Engineering info. Data from sensors, log reports, photos etc. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Applications that we cannot program by hand</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Autonomous helicopter.</li>
            <li>Handwriting recognition.</li>
            <li>Natural language processing (NLP).</li>
            <li>Computer vision.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Self customizing programs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Netflix</li>
            <li>Amazon</li>
            <li>iTunes genius</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What is machine learning?</h2>
        <h3>Arthur Samuel (1959)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>‚ÄùField of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed‚Äù.</li>
            <li>Samuels created a checkers software and had it play 10,000 games against itself. Work out which board positions were good and bad depending on wins/losses.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Tom Michel (1999)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>‚ÄùA computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E‚Äù.</li>
            <li>The checkers example: E = 10000s games, T is playing checkers, P if you win or not.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Several types of learning algorithms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Supervised learning: Teach the computer how to do something, then let it use it‚Äôs new found knowledge to do it.</li>
            <li>Unsupervised learning: Let the computer learn how to do something, and use this to determine structure and patterns in data.</li>
            <li>Reinforcement learning.</li>
            <li>Recommender systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Supervised learning - introduction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Probably the most prevalent form of machine learning type.</li>
            <li>Example: How can we predict housing prices? Ans: Collect house pricing data and examine how it relates to size in feet.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example problem</h3>
        <p><img alt="house_price_prediction" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37275728/201469371-44d7837e-be00-4328-a978-0a63783e08c1.png" /></p>
        <p>‚ÄùGiven this data, a friend has a house 750 square feet how much can they be expected to get?‚Äù</p>
        <p>What approaches can we use to solve this?
            * Straight line through data. Maybe $150,000.
            * Second order polynomial. Maybe $200,000.
            * One point we‚Äôll go over later is whether to use a straight or curved line.
            * Each of these techniques is a method of carrying out supervised learning.</p>
        <p>We also call this a regression problem
            * Predict continuous valued output (price).
            * No real discrete delineation.</p>
        <p><img alt="malignant_cancer" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37275728/201469417-2f5449d2-62b4-4f36-8eb2-77abc4cb0adf.png" /></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can you estimate the prognosis based on the tumor‚Äôs size?</li>
            <li>This is an example of a classification problem.</li>
            <li>Classify data into one of two categories - malignant or not - with no in- betweens.</li>
            <li>In classification problems, the output can only have a discrete number of potential values.
                You may have many attributes to consider.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also call this a regression problem
            * Predict continuous valued output (price).
            * No real discrete delineation.
            *
            <img alt="age_vs_tumor" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37275728/201469444-d574fbc0-8ed9-4378-a8a4-9c8f44062199.png" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can try to establish different classes based on that data by drawing a straight line between the two groups.</li>
            <li>Defining the two groups with a more sophisticated function (which we‚Äôll go over later)</li>
            <li>Then, when you have someone with a certain tumor size and age, you can ideally utilize that information to assign them to one of your classes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Unsupervised learning - introduction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Second major type.</li>
            <li>We use labeled datasets (as opposed to unlabeled).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Clustering algorithm</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Google news. Groups news stories into cohesive groups.</li>
            <li>Genomics.</li>
            <li>Microarray data. Have a group of individuals. On each measure expression of a gene. Run algorithm to cluster individuals into types of people.</li>
            <li>Organize computer clusters. Identify potential weak spots or distribute workload effectively.</li>
            <li>Social network analysis. Customer data.</li>
            <li>Astronomical data analysis. Algorithms give amazing results.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cocktail party problem</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Depending on where your microphone is, record slightly different versions of the conversation.</li>
            <li>Give the recordings to the algorithm.</li>
            <li>It should be able to figure out that there are two audio sources.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>$$[W,s,v] = svd((repmat(sum(x.<em>x,1), size(x,1),1).</em>x)*x');$$</p>
