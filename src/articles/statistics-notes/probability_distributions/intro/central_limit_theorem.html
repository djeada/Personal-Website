            <h2 id="central-limit-theorem-clt-">Central Limit Theorem (CLT)</h2>
            <p>The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics, explaining why the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution, often known as the bell curve, as the sample size becomes larger, irrespective of the population's original distribution.</p>
            <h3 id="mathematical-background">Mathematical Background</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement</strong>: The CLT states that if you have a population with a mean $\mu$ and a standard deviation $\sigma$, and you take sufficiently large random samples from this population (with replacement), then the distribution of the sample means will approximate a normal distribution.</li>
                <li>The mean of the sample means ($\bar{X}$) will be approximately equal to the population mean ($\mu$).</li>
                <li>The standard deviation of the sample means, also known as the standard error, will be $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$, where $n$ is the sample size.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="formal-description">Formal Description</h3>
            <p>Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, each with a mean $\mu$ and a variance $\sigma^2$.</p>
            <p>As $n$ (the sample size) tends to infinity, the distribution of the standardized sum</p>
            <p>$$\frac{X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_n - n\mu}{\sigma\sqrt{n}}$$</p>
            <p>converges in distribution to a standard normal distribution. Mathematically, this is expressed as:</p>
            <p>$$P\left(\frac{X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_n - n\mu}{\sigma\sqrt{n}} \leq a\right) \to \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{a} e^{-x^2/2} \, dx$$</p>
            <h3 id="key-points">Key Points</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Sufficiently Large Samples</strong>: "Large" is typically considered to be a sample size of 30 or more, though this can vary based on the distribution's initial shape.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Independence</strong>: Samples should be independent of each other.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Sample Means</strong>: It's the distribution of the means of these samples that becomes normal, not the distribution of the individual data points.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="implications-and-applications">Implications and Applications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Universal Applicability</strong>: The CLT is applicable to almost any population distribution, given a sufficiently large sample size. This includes distributions that are not normally distributed.</li>
                <li><strong>Predictive Power</strong>: It allows statisticians to make inferences about population parameters using sample statistics, particularly when dealing with large datasets.</li>
                <li><strong>Practicality in Sampling</strong>: It underpins many statistical procedures and experiments, where it's often impractical or impossible to observe an entire population.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sample Size</strong>: The theorem applies only when the sample size is large enough. "Large enough" varies depending on the underlying distribution, but a common rule of thumb is a sample size greater than 30.</li>
                <li><strong>Independence</strong>: The sampled values must be independent of each other. This assumption can be violated in many real-world scenarios.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="visualization">Visualization</h3>
            <p>A histogram of the sample means will tend to form a bell-shaped curve as the number of samples increases, reflecting the normal distribution predicted by the CLT.</p>
            <h4 id="data-generation">Data Generation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Population Data</strong>: Generated from a non-normal (exponential) distribution.</li>
                <li><strong>Distribution Used</strong>: Exponential distribution with a scale parameter of 1.0.</li>
                <li><strong>Population Size</strong>: 10,000 data points.</li>
                <li><strong>Sample Details</strong>: Number of Samples = 1000, Sample Size = 50.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="calculation-of-sample-means">Calculation of Sample Means</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Method</strong>: For each of the 1000 samples, a sample mean is calculated.</li>
                <li><strong>Formula</strong>: $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$, where $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $n$ is the sample size, and $x_i$ are the data points in the sample.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="visualization">Visualization</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A histogram is created to show the distribution of these 1000 sample means.</li>
                <li>According to the Central Limit Theorem, this distribution should approximate a normal distribution.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><img alt="fbb216aa-d334-4871-bd7d-bbc581bcb657" src="https://github.com/djeada/Statistics-Notes/assets/37275728/fba99241-8f11-4cc2-98ac-5951bd02e6f7" /></p>
            <h4 id="results">Results</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mean of Population Data</strong>: Approximately 1.01.</li>
                <li><strong>Mean of Sample Means</strong>: Also approximately 1.01. This indicates that the average of the sample means is very close to the population mean, aligning with the CLT's prediction.</li>
                <li><strong>Standard Error</strong>: Calculated as $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$, where $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation and $n$ is the sample size. The calculated standard error was approximately 0.14.</li>
                <li>The histogram of the sample means formed a bell-shaped curve, indicating a normal distribution as predicted by the Central Limit Theorem.</li>
                <li>The close alignment of the mean of the sample means with the population mean, and the calculated standard error, further confirm the theorem's predictions.</li>
                <li>This example underscores the theorem's key insight: for a sufficiently large sample size, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the population's original distribution.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="example-applying-the-central-limit-theorem-clt-">Example: Applying the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)</h3>
            <p>Consider a scenario where the heights of a certain plant species are normally distributed, with a mean of 15 cm and a standard deviation of 3 cm. We analyze random samples of different sizes.</p>
            <h4 id="sample-size-of-16-plants">Sample Size of 16 Plants</h4>
            <p>Estimate the probability of the sample mean height being between 14 and 16 cm.</p>
            <p>CLT estimation: The CLT suggests that the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed. The probability should be significant since the range includes the mean.</p>
            <p>Calculated Solution: Calculate the Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) using $SEM = \frac{3}{\sqrt{16}}$. Calculate the Z-scores for 14 and 16 cm, finding the probability from the standard normal distribution as approximately 81.76%.</p>
            <h4 id="sample-size-of-64-plants">Sample Size of 64 Plants</h4>
            <p>Estimate the probability for the same range with 64 plants.</p>
            <p>CLT estimation: As the sample size increases, the sampling distribution becomes more normal and narrower. The probability of the sample mean falling within this range should increase.</p>
            <p>Calculated Solution: With $n = 64$, the SEM decreases. Recalculating the Z-scores shows the probability increases to about 99.23%.</p>
            <h4 id="sample-size-of-144-plants">Sample Size of 144 Plants</h4>
            <p>Estimate the probability for the same range with a sample size of 144.</p>
            <p>CLT estimation: A larger sample size should result in a probability nearing certainty, as per the CLT, because the sample mean distribution becomes increasingly normal.</p>
            <p>Calculated Solution: Increasing the sample size to 144 further reduces the SEM. The probability approaches 99.99%.</p>
            <h4 id="unknown-population-distribution">Unknown Population Distribution</h4>
            <p>Estimate the probability if the plant heights' distribution is not known to be normal.</p>
            <p>CLT estimation: The CLT assures that with large sample sizes (typically $n \geq 30$), the sampling distribution of the sample mean approximates normality. The method remains applicable, assuming a sufficiently large sample size.</p>
            <p>Calculated Solution: Not applicable in this case as the population distribution is unknown. The estimation relies solely on the CLT.</p>
