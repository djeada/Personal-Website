            <p>Descriptive statistics offer a summary of the main characteristics of a dataset or sample. They facilitate the understanding and interpretation of data by providing measures of central tendency, dispersion, and shape. In this section, we will discuss the essential concepts and measures in descriptive statistics.</p>
            <h2 id="frequencies-and-frequency-tables">Frequencies and Frequency Tables</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frequency</strong>: The number of times a specific value or category occurs in a dataset. For instance, if 3 people have 1 sibling, the frequency for "1 sibling" is 3.</li>
                <li><strong>Relative Frequency</strong>: The proportion of times a specific value occurs relative to the total number of observations. Calculated as:</li>
            </ul>
            <p>$$\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Frequency}}{\text{Total Observations}}$$</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cumulative Relative Frequency</strong>: The accumulation of previous relative frequencies up to a certain category. It shows the proportion of observations up to and including a certain category. Calculated as:</li>
            </ul>
            <p>$$\text{Cumulative Relative Frequency} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{Relative Frequency}_i$$</p>
            <p>Be careful cumulative frequencies don't make sense when the data doesn't have natural order!</p>
            <p>Example: List of People and Their Sibling Count</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Alice - 2 siblings</li>
                <li>Bob - 0 siblings</li>
                <li>Charlie - 1 sibling</li>

            <h3 id="continuous-data">Continuous data</h3>
            <p>Continuous data can take any value within a range, making it impractical to calculate frequency for each exact number. For example, consider measuring the heights of a group of people. Heights can vary infinitely within a range (e.g., 170.1 cm, 170.2 cm, 170.25 cm), making it unfeasible to have a frequency for each distinct measurement.</p>
            <p>Instead, we group continuous data into intervals or ranges and then calculate frequencies for these intervals. This approach simplifies the data and makes it more interpretable.</p>
            <p>Example: Height Measurements (in cm) of a Group of People</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Raw Data (Continuous):</li>

            <h2 id="measures-of-central-tendency">Measures of Central Tendency</h2>
            <p>Measures of central tendency provide an idea of the average or central value of the dataset.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Arithmetic Mean:</strong> Suitable for characterizing symmetric distributions without outliers. It's also the balancing point of a distribution.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>$$\mu_{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum x$$</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weighted Mean:</strong> Takes into account the importance or weight of each value in the dataset.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>$$\mu_{X} = \frac{\sum w_ix_i}{\sum w_i}$$</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Geometric Mean:</strong> Ideal for averaging ratios or handling multiplicative data. Always smaller than the arithmetic mean.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>$$\text{mean} =\sqrt[n]{a_{1}a_{2}...a_{n}}$$</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Median:</strong> The precise middle value among a dataset when sorted in ascending order. Suitable for skewed distributions or data with outliers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Mode:</strong> The most frequently occurring element in a dataset.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="example">Example</h3>
            <p>Measures of central tendency help us identify the middle value in a dataset. Let's consider a dataset representing the number of sales per day for a store during a week:</p>

            </table>
            </p>
            <p>We can use different measures to determine the central value: mean, median, and mode.</p>
            <h4 id="mean">Mean</h4>
            <p>The mean (or average) is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. In this example:</p>
            <p>$$
                \text{Mean} = \frac{17 + 21 + 17 + 35 + 23 + 14 + 24}{7} \approx 21.57
                $$</p>
            <h4 id="median">Median</h4>
            <p>The median is the middle value in the sorted dataset. For our example, after sorting:</p>
            <p>
            <table>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>17</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

            </p>
            <p>The median value is 21.</p>
            <h4 id="mode">Mode</h4>
            <p>The mode is the most frequently occurring value. In our example, the mode is 17, as it occurs twice:</p>
            <p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Sales</td>

                <tr>
                    <td><strong>17</strong></td>

                <tr>
                    <td><strong>17</strong></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>21</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>23</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>24</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>35</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            </p>
            <p>Each measure of central tendency can provide different insights into the dataset. In this example, the mean is slightly affected by the larger sales number on Thursday, while the median and mode give a more typical representation of the central value.</p>

            <h3 id="when-choosing-mean-or-median-">When Choosing Mean or Median:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you want to minimize the effect of outliers, then use <strong>median</strong> instead of mean.</li>
                <li>If itâ€™s important that you consider all values, including outliers, then use <strong>mean</strong> instead of median.</li>
                <li>Typically we should be very cautious of using the mean for skewed data. The median is often a more honest measurement of average in such a setting.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>EXAMPLE 1</p>
            <p>Alice is looking into the salaries of graphic designers at a well-established tech company to gauge her potential earnings. Given that the company has a few top-level designers earning significantly higher than the rest, which would give her a more realistic expectation of salary, the mean or the median?</p>
            <p>Answer: The median would better represent her potential earnings because it would not be as affected by the high salaries of the few top-level designers, thus providing a more typical value of what graphic designers at the company earn.
                EXAMPLE 2</p>
            <p>Tom is the manager of a small bookstore and needs to report the average customer spending to the owner. Considering that most customers spend around $20, but there are occasional rare purchases of rare books costing over $500, should Tom use the mean or median to report this spending?</p>
            <p>Answer: Tom should use the median to report average customer spending. The rare expensive purchases are outliers and would skew the mean, making it seem like the average customer spends more than they typically do.</p>
            <h2 id="measures-of-dispersion">Measures of Dispersion</h2>
            <p>Dispersion measures indicate the spread or variability of the data in the dataset.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Range:</strong> The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Interquartile Range (IQR):</strong> The difference between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). Represents the range encompassing the central 50% of the data.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Variance:</strong> The average of the squared differences from the mean.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>$$V = \frac{\sum (x_i - \overline{x})^2}{N-1}$$ (for a sample)</p>
            <p>$$V = \frac{\sum (x_i - \overline{x})^2}{N}$$ (for a population)</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> The square root of the variance. Indicates the degree to which individual elements deviate from the mean.</li>

            <h3 id="understanding-standard-deviation">Understanding Standard deviation</h3>
            <p>Consider that Chloe swam the 100m freestyle in 53 seconds at a regional competition, and Liam completed a marathon in 2 hours and 55 minutes at a city event. Who performed more exceptionally compared to typical results?</p>
            <p>Given Information:
                - Average 100m freestyle time (Î¼) = 60 seconds
                - Standard Deviation for 100m freestyle (Ïƒ) = 4 seconds
                - Average marathon time (Î¼) = 4 hours
                - Standard Deviation for marathon (Ïƒ) = 30 minutes</p>
            <p>Analysis:
                - Chloe's swim time is (60 - 53) / 4 = 1.75 SDs below the mean time (faster is better in this context).
                - Liam's marathon time, converted to minutes is 175 minutes. The average is 240 minutes. So, his time is (240 - 175) / 30 = 2.17 SDs below the mean time.</p>
            <p>Conclusion:
                Liam's performance in the marathon is more exceptional as his time is 2.17 SDs better than the average, compared to Chloe's swim time, which is 1.75 SDs better than the average for the 100m freestyle.</p>
            <h3 id="understanding-variance">Understanding Variance</h3>
            <p>Variance is an intrinsic aspect of the universe.
                Obtaining identical results after repeated observations of the same event is impossible due to random noise or error. Variance can be attributed to sampling or measurement errors. In some cases, variance results from the random fluctuations of the universe.</p>
            <h3 id="example">Example</h3>
            <p>Measures of dispersion help us understand the spread or variability of data in a dataset. Continuing with the store sales dataset:</p>

            <p>We can use different measures to determine the dispersion: range, variance, and standard deviation.</p>
            <h4 id="range">Range</h4>
            <p>The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. In this example:</p>
            <p>$$
                \text{Range} = 35 - 14 = 21
                $$</p>
            <h4 id="variance">Variance</h4>
            <p>Variance measures the average squared difference of each value from the mean. For our example, first, we need to calculate the mean:</p>
            <p>$$
                \text{Mean} \approx 21.57
                $$</p>
            <p>Now, we can calculate the variance:</p>
            <p>$$
                \text{Variance} = \frac{(17 - 21.57)^2 + (21 - 21.57)^2 + (17 - 21.57)^2 + (35 - 21.57)^2 + (23 - 21.57)^2 + (14 - 21.57)^2 + (24 - 21.57)^2}{7} \approx 47.39
                $$</p>
            <h4 id="standard-deviation">Standard Deviation</h4>
            <p>The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. In our example:</p>
            <p>$$
                \text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{47.39} \approx 6.88
                $$</p>
            <p>Each measure of dispersion provides different information about the spread of the dataset. The range gives us an overall view of the spread, but it can be influenced by extreme values. The variance and standard deviation give a more detailed representation of the dispersion and are less sensitive to outliers.</p>

            <h2 id="percentiles-and-quartiles">Percentiles and Quartiles</h2>
            <p>Percentiles and quartiles provide a way to understand the distribution of values in a dataset, going beyond the range. The range is not always helpful, as it doesn't give much information about how values are distributed around the mean or about the comparative position of an individual value within the distribution.</p>
            <h3 id="percentiles">Percentiles</h3>
            <p>A percentile tells us where a given value is ranked in the overall distribution. For example, 25% of the data in a distribution has a value lower than the 25th percentile; 75% of the data has a value lower than the 75th percentile, and so on. The 50th percentile is also the median.</p>
            <p>To calculate the percentile for a given value, use the following equation:</p>
            <p>$$
                \frac{\text{Number of values less than the given value}}{\text{Total number of values}} \times 100
                $$</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>Consider a dataset of exam scores: $[40, 30, 15, 24, 20, 22, 35]$.</p>
            <p>Let's calculate the 30th percentile of this dataset.</p>
            <p>Sort the dataset in ascending order: $[15, 20, 22, 24, 30, 35, 40]$.</p>
            <p>Calculate the rank (i) using the formula:</p>
            <p>$$i = \frac{P \times (n + 1)}{100}$$</p>
            <p>Where P is the percentile (in our case, 30) and n is the total number of values (7).</p>
            <p>$$i = \frac{30 \times (7 + 1)}{100} = 2.4$$</p>
            <p>Since i is not an integer, interpolate between the two nearest values in the sorted dataset:</p>
            <p>$$value = (1 - r) \times value_i + r \times value_{i+1}$$</p>
            <p>Where r is the decimal part of i (0.4 in this case), and $value_i$ and $value_{i+1}$ are the 2nd and 3rd values in the sorted dataset (20 and 22, respectively).</p>
            <p>$$value = (1 - 0.4) \times 20 + 0.4 \times 22 = 20.8$$</p>
            <p>So, the 30th percentile of the dataset is 20.8.</p>
            <p><img alt="5ea8e097-b512-40b2-8959-b9d88f4657af" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djeada/Statistics-Notes/assets/37275728/f940e95e-4e08-4696-ab10-618cdb49b6da" /></p>
            <h3 id="quartiles">Quartiles</h3>
            <p>Quartiles divide the data into four equal parts using percentiles. The first quartile contains the values from the minimum to the 25th percentile, the second from the 25th percentile to the 50th percentile (which is the median), the third from the 50th percentile to the 75th percentile, and the fourth from the 75th percentile to the maximum.</p>
            <p>To find the quartile thresholds, use the following quantiles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First Quartile: $0.25$</li>
                <li>Second Quartile (Median): $0.5$</li>
                <li>Third Quartile: $0.75$</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>Consider a dataset of exam scores: $[40, 30, 15, 24, 20, 22, 35]$.</p>
            <p>To calculate quartiles, follow these steps:</p>
            <p>Calculate the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles using the same method as above.</p>
            <p>For the 25th percentile (Q1):</p>
            <p>$$i = \frac{25 \times (7 + 1)}{100} = 2$$</p>
            <p>Since i is not an integer, the value is the 2nd value in the sorted dataset:</p>
            <p>$$Q1 = 20$$</p>
            <p>For the 50th percentile (Q2):</p>
            <p>$$i = \frac{50 \times (7 + 1)}{100} = 4$$</p>
            <p>Since i is an integer, the value is the 4th value in the sorted dataset:</p>
            <p>$$Q2 = 24$$</p>
            <p>For the 75th percentile (Q3):</p>
            <p>$$i = \frac{75 \times (7 + 1)}{100} = 6$$</p>
            <p>Since i is an integer, the value is the 6th value in the sorted dataset:</p>
            <p>$$Q3 = 35$$</p>
            <p>So, the quartiles of the dataset are Q1 = 20, Q2 = 24, and Q3 = 35.</p>
