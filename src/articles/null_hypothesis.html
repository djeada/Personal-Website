            <h2 id="null-hypotheses-and-alternative-hypotheses">Null Hypotheses and Alternative Hypotheses</h2>
            <p>In hypothesis testing, we start with a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (H1). The null hypothesis is a statement that assumes there is no effect or relationship between the variables being tested. The alternative hypothesis is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is an effect or relationship.</p>
            <h3 id="why-fail-to-reject-null-hypothesis-instead-of-accepting-alternative-hypothesis-">Why "Fail to reject null hypothesis" instead of "Accepting Alternative Hypothesis"?</h3>
            <p>When we have a high p-value, it means we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This does not necessarily mean that the alternative hypothesis is true. A high p-value indicates that the data is consistent with the null hypothesis, but it does not rule out the possibility that the data could also be consistent with other hypotheses.</p>
            <p>The reason we say "fail to reject" instead of "accepting alternative hypothesis" is that not having enough evidence against the null hypothesis does not automatically mean that the opposite is true. In other words, the data may be consistent with the null hypothesis but could also be consistent with other hypotheses.</p>
            <h3 id="example-coin-toss">Example: Coin Toss</h3>
            <p>For example, suppose we test the null hypothesis that a coin is fair (p[heads] = 0.5) and observe 6 tails and 4 heads in 10 flips. This result seems consistent with a fair coin, and we would not reject the null hypothesis using a standard test.</p>
            <p>However, this does not mean that the coin is necessarily fair. The data is more consistent with p[heads] = 0.4 than the null hypothesis. In this case, a high p-value would simply indicate that the data is consistent with the coin being fair, but it does not rule out the possibility that the coin is biased.</p>
            <p>To make a stronger conclusion, we would need more data, better experimental design, or additional tests that take into account other information or background knowledge.</p>
            <p>The key takeaway is that failing to reject the null hypothesis does not automatically mean that the alternative hypothesis is false. It only means that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and further investigation might be required to draw more accurate conclusions.</p>
